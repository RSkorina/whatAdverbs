 the first forty nine preface to the first forty nine the first four stories are the last ones i have written the others follow in the order in which they were originally published the first one i wrote was up in michigan written in paris in 1921 the last was old man at the bridge cabled from barcelona in april of 1938 beside the fifth column i wrote the killers today is friday ten indians part of the sun also rises and the first third of to have and have not in madrid it was always a good place for working so was paris and so were key west florida in the cool months the ranch near cooke city montana kansas city chicago toronto and havana cuba some other places were not so good but maybe we were not so good when we were in them there are many kinds of stories in this book i hope that you will find some that you like reading them over the ones i liked the best outside of those that have achieved some notoriety so that school teachers include them in story collections that their pupils have to buy in story courses and you are always faintly embarrassed to read them and wonder whether you really wrote them or did you maybe hear them somewhere are the short happy life of francis macomber in another country hills like white elephants a way you ll never be the snows of kilimanjaro a clean well lighted place and a story called the light of the world which nobody else ever liked there are some others too because if you did not like them you would not publish them in going where you have to go and doing what you have to do and seeing what you have to see you dull and blunt the instrument you write with but i would rather have it bent and dull and know i had to put it on the grindstone again and hammer it into shape and put a whetstone to it and know that i had something to write about than to have it bright and shining and nothing to say or smooth and well oiled in the closet but unused now it is necessary to get to the grindstone again i would like to live long enough to write three more novels and twenty five more stories i know some pretty good ones ernest hemingway 1938 the short happy life of francis macomber it was now lunch time and they were all sitting under the double green fly of the dining tent pretending that nothing had happened will you have lime juice or lemon squash macomber asked i ll have a gimlet robert wilson told him i ll have a gimlet too i need something macomber s wife said i suppose it s the thing to do macomber agreed tell him to make three gimlets the mess boy had started them already lifting the bottles out of the canvas cooling bags that sweated wet in the wind that blew through the trees that shaded the tents what had i ought to give them macomber asked a quid would be plenty wilson told him you don t want to spoil them will the headman distribute it absolutely francis macomber had half an hour before been carried to his tent from the edge of the camp in triumph on the arms and shoulders of the cook the personal boys the skinner and the porters the gun bearers had taken no part in the demonstration when the native boys put him down at the door of his tent he had shaken all their hands received their congratulations and then gone into the tent and sat on the bed until his wife came in she did not speak to him when she came in and he left the tent at once to wash his face and hands in the portable wash basin outside and go over to the dining tent to sit in a comfortable canvas chair in the breeze and the shade you ve got your lion robert wilson said to him and a damned fine one too mrs macomber looked at wilson quickly she was an extremely handsome and well kept woman of the beauty and social position which had five years before commanded five thousand dollars as the price of endorsing with photographs a beauty product which she had never used she had been married to francis macomber for eleven years he is a good lion isn t he macomber said his wife looked at him now she looked at both these men as though she had never seen them before one wilson the white hunter she knew she had never truly seen before he was about middle height with sandy hair a stubby mustache a very red face and extremely cold blue eyes with faint white wrinkles at the corners that grooved merrily when he smiled he smiled at her now and she looked away from his face at the way his shoulders sloped in the loose tunic he wore with the four big cartridges held in loops where the left breast pocket should have been at his big brown hands his old slacks his very dirty boots and back to his red face again she noticed where the baked red of his face stopped in a white line that marked the circle left by his stetson hat that hung now from one of the pegs of the tent pole well here s to the lion robert wilson said he smiled at her again and not smiling she looked curiously at her husband francis macomber was very tall very well built if you did not mind that length of bone dark his hair cropped like an oarsman rather thin lipped and was considered handsome he was dressed in the same sort of safari clothes that wilson wore except that his were new he was thirty five years old kept himself very fit was good at court games had a number of big game fishing records and had just shown himself very publicly to be a coward here s to the lion he said i can t ever thank you for what you did margaret his wife looked away from him and back to wilson let s not talk about the lion she said wilson looked over at her without smiling and now she smiled at him it s been a very strange day she said hadn t you ought to put your hat on even under the canvas at noon you told me that you know might put it on said wilson you know you have a very red face mr wilson she told him and smiled again drink said wilson i don t think so she said francis drinks a great deal but his face is never red it s red today macomber tried a joke no said margaret it s mine that s red today but mr wilson s is always red must be racial said wilson i say you wouldn t like to drop my beauty as a topic would you i ve just started on it let s chuck it said wilson conversation is going to be so difficult margaret said don t be silly margot her husband said no difficulty wilson said got a damn fine lion margot looked at them both and they both saw that she was going to cry wilson had seen it coming for a long time and he dreaded it macomber was past dreading it i wish it hadn t happened oh i wish it hadn t happened she said and started for her tent she made no noise of crying but they could see that her shoulders were shaking under the rose colored sun proofed shirt she wore women upset said wilson to the tall man amounts to nothing strain on the nerves and one thing n another no said macomber i suppose that i rate that for the rest of my life now nonsense let s have a spot of the giant killer said wilson forget the whole thing nothing to it anyway we might try said macomber i won t forget what you did for me though nothing said wilson all nonsense so they sat there in the shade where the camp was pitched under some wide topped acacia trees with a boulder strewn cliff behind them and a stretch of grass that ran to the bank of a boulder filled stream in front with forest beyond it and drank their just cool lime drinks and avoided one another s eyes while the boys set the table for lunch wilson could tell that the boys all knew about it now and when he saw macomber s personal boy looking curiously at his master while he was putting dishes on the table he snapped at him in swahili the boy turned away with his face blank what were you telling him macomber asked nothing told him to look alive or i d see he got about fifteen of the best what s that lashes it s quite illegal wilson said you re supposed to fine them do you still have them whipped oh yes they could raise a row if they chose to complain but they don t they prefer it to the fines how strange said macomber not strange really wilson said which would you rather do take a good birching or lose your pay then he felt embarrassed at asking it and before macomber could answer he went on we all take a beating every day you know one way or another this was no better good god he thought i am a diplomat aren t i yes we take a beating said macomber still not looking at him i m awfully sorry about that lion business it doesn t have to go any further does it i mean no one will hear about it will they you mean will i tell it at the mathaiga club wilson looked at him now coldly he had not expected this so he s a bloody four letter man as well as a bloody coward he thought i rather liked him too until today but how is one to know about an american no said wilson i m a professional hunter we never talk about our clients you can be quite easy on that it s supposed to be bad form to ask us not to talk though he had decided now that to break would be much easier he would eat then by himself and could read a book with his meals they would eat by themselves he would see them through the safari on a very formal basis what was it the french called it distinguished consideration and it would be a damn sight easier than having to go through this emotional trash he d insult him and make a good clean break then he could read a book with his meals and he d still be drinking their whisky that was the phrase for it when a safari went bad you ran into another white hunter and you asked how is everything going and he answered oh i m still drinking their whisky and you knew everything had gone to pot i m sorry macomber said and looked at him with his american face that would stay adolescent until it became middle aged and wilson noted his crew cropped hair fine eyes only faintly shifty good nose thin lips and handsome jaw i m sorry i didn t realize that there are lots of things i don t know so what could he do wilson thought he was all ready to break it off quickly and neatly and here the beggar was apologizing after he had just insulted him he made one more attempt don t worry about me talking he said i have a living to make you know in africa no woman ever misses her lion and no white man ever bolts i bolted like a rabbit macomber said now what in hell were you going to do about a man who talked like that wilson wondered wilson looked at macomber with his flat blue machine gunner s eyes and the other smiled back at him he had a pleasant smile if you did not notice how his eyes showed when he was hurt maybe i can fix it up on buffalo he said we re after them next aren t we in the morning if you like wilson told him perhaps he had been wrong this was certainly the way to take it you most certainly could not tell a damned thing about an american he was all for macomber again if you could forget the morning but of course you couldn t the morning had been about as bad as they come here comes the memsahib he said she was walking over from her tent looking refreshed and cheerful and quite lovely she had a very perfect oval face so perfect that you expected her to be stupid but she wasn t stupid wilson thought no not stupid how is the beautiful red faced mr wilson are you feeling better francis my pearl oh much said macomber i ve dropped the whole thing she said sitting down at the table what importance is there to whether francis is any good at killing lions that s not his trade that s mr wilson s trade mr wilson is really very impressive killing anything you do kill anything don t you oh anything said wilson simply anything they are he thought the hardest in the world the hardest the cruelest the most predatory and the most attractive and their men have softened or gone to pieces nervously as they have hardened or is it that they pick men they can handle they can t know that much at the age they marry he thought he was grateful that he had gone through his education on american women before now because this was a very attractive one we re going after buff in the morning he told her i m coming she said no you re not oh yes i am mayn t i francis why not stay in camp not for anything she said i wouldn t miss something like today for anything when she left wilson was thinking when she went off to cry she seemed a hell of a fine woman she seemed to understand to realize to be hurt for him and for herself and to know how things really stood she is away for twenty minutes and now she is back simply enamelled in that american female cruelty they are the damnedest women really the damnedest we ll put on another show for you tomorrow francis macomber said you re not coming wilson said you re very mistaken she told him and i want so to see you perform again you were lovely this morning that is if blowing things heads off is lovely here s the lunch said wilson you re very merry aren t you why not i didn t come out here to be dull well it hasn t been dull wilson said he could see the boulders in the river and the high bank beyond with the trees and he remembered the morning oh no she said it s been charming and tomorrow you don t know how i look forward to tomorrow that s eland he s offering you wilson said they re the big cowy things that jump like hares aren t they i suppose that describes them wilson said it s very good meat macomber said did you shoot it francis she asked yes they re not dangerous are they only if they fall on you wilson told her i m so glad why not let up on the bitchery just a little margot macomber said cutting the eland steak and putting some mashed potato gravy and carrot on the down turned fork that tined through the piece of meat i suppose i could she said since you put it so prettily tonight we ll have champagne for the lion wilson said it s a bit too hot at noon oh the lion margot said i d forgotten the lion so robert wilson thought to himself she is giving him a ride isn t she or do you suppose that s her idea of putting up a good show how should a woman act when she discovers her husband is a bloody coward she s damn cruel but they re all cruel they govern of course and to govern one has to be cruel sometimes still i ve seen enough of their damn terrorism have some more eland he said to her politely that afternoon late wilson and macomber went out in the motor car with the native driver and the two gun bearers mrs macomber stayed in the camp it was too hot to go out she said and she was going with them in the early morning as they drove off wilson saw her standing under the big tree looking pretty rather than beautiful in her faintly rosy khaki her dark hair drawn back off her forehead and gathered in a knot low on her neck her face as fresh he thought as though she were in england she waved to them as the car went off through the swale of high grass and curved around through the trees into the small hills of orchard bush in the orchard bush they found a herd of impala and leaving the car they stalked one old ram with long wide spread horns and macomber killed it with a very creditable shot that knocked the buck down at a good two hundred yards and sent the herd off bounding wildly and leaping over one another s backs in long leg drawn up leaps as unbelievable and as floating as those one makes sometimes in dreams that was a good shot wilson said they re a small target is it a worth while head macomber asked it s excellent wilson told him you shoot like that and you ll have no trouble do you think we ll find buffalo tomorrow there s a good chance of it they feed out early in the morning and with luck we may catch them in the open i d like to clear away that lion business macomber said it s not very pleasant to have your wife see you do something like that i should think it would be even more unpleasant to do it wilson thought wife or no wife or to talk about it having done it but he said i wouldn t think about that any more any one could be upset by his first lion that s all over but that night after dinner and a whisky and soda by the fire before going to bed as francis macomber lay on his cot with the mosquito bar over him and listened to the night noises it was not all over it was neither all over nor was it beginning it was there exactly as it happened with some parts of it indelibly emphasized and he was miserably ashamed at it but more than shame he felt cold hollow fear in him the fear was still there like a cold slimy hollow in all the emptiness where once his confidence had been and it made him feel sick it was still there with him now it had started the night before when he had wakened and heard the lion roaring somewhere up along the river it was a deep sound and at the end there were sort of coughing grunts that made him seem just outside the tent and when francis macomber woke in the night to hear it he was afraid he could hear his wife breathing quietly asleep there was no one to tell he was afraid nor to be afraid with him and lying alone he did not know the somali proverb that says a brave man is always frightened three times by a lion when he first sees his track when he first hears him roar and when he first confronts him then while they were eating breakfast by lantern light out in the dining tent before the sun was up the lion roared again and francis thought he was just at the edge of camp sounds like an old timer robert wilson said looking up from his kippers and coffee listen to him cough is he very close a mile or so up the stream will we see him we ll have a look does his roaring carry that far it sounds as though he were right in camp carries a hell of a long way said robert wilson it s strange the way it carries hope he s a shootable cat the boys said there was a very big one about here if i get a shot where should i hit him macomber asked to stop him in the shoulders wilson said in the neck if you can make it shoot for bone break him down i hope i can place it properly macomber said you shoot very well wilson told him take your time make sure of him the first one in is the one that counts what range will it be can t tell lion has something to say about that don t shoot unless it s close enough so you can make sure at under a hundred yards macomber asked wilson looked at him quickly hundred s about right might have to take him a bit under shouldn t chance a shot at much over that a hundred s a decent range you can hit him wherever you want at that here comes the memsahib good morning she said are we going after that lion as soon as you deal with your breakfast wilson said how are you feeling marvellous she said i m very excited i ll just go and see that everything is ready wilson went off as he left the lion roared again noisy beggar wilson said we ll put a stop to that what s the matter francis his wife asked him nothing macomber said yes there is she said what are you upset about nothing he said tell me she looked at him don t you feel well it s that damned roaring he said it s been going on all night you know why didn t you wake me she said i d love to have heard it i ve got to kill the damned thing macomber said miserably well that s what you re out here for isn t it yes but i m nervous hearing the thing roar gets on my nerves well then as wilson said kill him and stop his roaring yes darling said francis macomber it sounds easy doesn t it you re not afraid are you of course not but i m nervous from hearing him roar all night you ll kill him marvellously she said i know you will i m awfully anxious to see it finish your breakfast and we ll be starting it s not light yet she said this is a ridiculous hour just then the lion roared in a deep chested moaning suddenly guttural ascending vibration that seemed to shake the air and ended in a sigh and a heavy deep chested grunt he sounds almost here macomber s wife said my god said macomber i hate that damned noise it s very impressive impressive it s frightful robert wilson came up then carrying his short ugly shockingly big bored 505 gibbs and grinning come on he said your gun bearer has your springfield and the big gun everything s in the car have you solids yes i m ready mrs macomber said must make him stop that racket wilson said you get in front the memsahib can sit back here with me they climbed into the motor car and in the gray first daylight moved off up the river through the trees macomber opened the breech of his rifle and saw he had metal cased bullets shut the bolt and put the rifle on safety he saw his hand was trembling he felt in his pocket for more cartridges and moved his fingers over the cartridges in the loops of his tunic front he turned back to where wilson sat in the rear seat of the doorless box bodied motor car beside his wife them both grinning with excitement and wilson leaned forward and whispered see the birds dropping means the old boy has left his kill on the far bank of the stream macomber could see above the trees vultures circling and plummeting down chances are he ll come to drink along here wilson whispered before he goes to lay up keep an eye out they were driving slowly along the high bank of the stream which here cut deeply to its boulderfilled bed and they wound in and out through big trees as they drove macomber was watching the opposite bank when he felt wilson take hold of his arm the car stopped there he is he heard the whisper ahead and to the right get out and take him he s a marvellous lion macomber saw the lion now he was standing almost broadside his great head up and turned toward them the early morning breeze that blew toward them was just stirring his dark mane and the lion looked huge silhouetted on the rise of bank in the gray morning light his shoulders heavy his barrel of a body bulking smoothly how far is he asked macomber raising his rifle about seventy five get out and take him why not shoot from where i am you don t shoot them from cars he heard wilson saying in his ear get out he s not going to stay there all day macomber stepped out of the curved opening at the side of the front seat onto the step and down onto the ground the lion still stood looking majestically and coolly toward this object that his eyes only showed in silhouette bulking like some super rhino there was no man smell carried toward him and he watched the object moving his great head a little from side to side then watching the object not afraid but hesitating before going down the bank to drink with such a thing opposite him he saw a man figure detach itself from it and he turned his heavy head and swung away toward the cover of the trees as he heard a cracking crash and felt the slam of a 30 06 220 grain solid bullet that bit his flank and ripped in sudden hot scalding nausea through his stomach he trotted heavy bigfooted swinging wounded full bellied through the trees toward the tall grass and cover and the crash came again to go past him ripping the air apart then it crashed again and he felt the blow as it hit his lower ribs and ripped on through blood sudden hot and frothy in his mouth and he galloped toward the high grass where he could crouch and not be seen and make them bring the crashing thing close enough so he could make a rush and get the man that held it macomber had not thought how the lion felt as he got out of the car he only knew his hands were shaking and as he walked away from the car it was almost impossible for him to make his legs move they were stiff in the thighs but he could feel the muscles fluttering he raised the rifle sighted on the junction of the lion s head and shoulders and pulled the trigger nothing happened though he pulled until he thought his finger would break then he knew he had the safety on and as he lowered the rifle to move the safety over he moved another frozen pace forward and the lion seeing his silhouette flow clear of the silhouette of the car turned and started off at a trot and as macomber fired he heard a whunk that meant that the bullet was home but the lion kept on going macomber shot again and every one saw the bullet throw a spout of dirt beyond the trotting lion he shot again remembering to lower his aim and they all heard the bullet hit and the lion went into a gallop and was in the tall grass before he had the bolt pushed forward macomber stood there feeling sick at his stomach his hands that held the springfield still cocked shaking and his wife and robert wilson were standing by him beside him too were the two gun bearers chattering in wakamba i hit him macomber said i hit him twice you gut shot him and you hit him somewhere forward wilson said without enthusiasm the gun bearers looked very grave they were silent now you may have killed him wilson went on we ll have to wait a while before we go in to find out what do you mean let him get sick before we follow him up oh said macomber he s a hell of a fine lion wilson said cheerfully he s gotten into a bad place though why is it bad can t see him until you re on him oh said macomber come on said wilson the memsahib can stay here in the car we ll go to have a look at the blood spoor stay here margot macomber said to his wife his mouth was very dry and it was hard for him to talk why she asked wilson says to we re going to have a look wilson said you stay here you can see even better from here all right wilson spoke in swahili to the driver he nodded and said yes bwana then they went down the steep bank and across the stream climbing over and around the boulders and up the other bank pulling up by some projecting roots and along it until they found where the lion had been trotting when macomber first shot there was dark blood on the short grass that the gun bearers pointed out with grass stems and that ran away behind the river bank trees what do we do asked macomber not much choice said wilson we can t bring the car over bank s too steep we ll let him stiffen up a bit and then you and i ll go in and have a look for him can t we set the grass on fire macomber asked too green can t we send beaters wilson looked at him appraisingly of course we can he said but it s just a touch murderous you see we know the lion s wounded you can drive an unwounded lion he ll move on ahead of a noise but a wounded lion s going to charge you can t see him until you re right on him he ll make himself perfectly flat in cover you wouldn t think would hide a hare you can t very well send boys in there to that sort of a show somebody bound to get mauled what about the gun bearers oh they ll go with us it s their shauri you see they signed on for it they don t look too happy though do they i don t want to go in there said macomber it was out before he knew he d said it neither do i said wilson very cheerily really no choice though then as an afterthought he glanced at macomber and saw suddenly how he was trembling and the pitiful look on his face you don t have to go in of course he said that s what i m hired for you know that s why i m so expensive you mean you d go in by yourself why not leave him there robert wilson whose entire occupation had been with the lion and the problem he presented and who had not been thinking about macomber except to note that he was rather windy suddenly felt as though he had opened the wrong door in a hotel and seen something shameful what do you mean why not just leave him you mean pretend to ourselves he hasn t been hit no just drop it it isn t done why not for one thing he s certain to be suffering for another some one else might run onto him i see but you don t have to have anything to do with it i d like to macomber said i m just scared you know i ll go ahead when we go in wilson said with kongoni tracking you keep behind me and a little to one side chances are we ll hear him growl if we see him we ll both shoot don t worry about anything i ll keep you backed up as a matter of fact you know perhaps you d better not go it might be much better why don t you go over and join the memsahib while i just get it over with no i want to go all right said wilson but don t go in if you don t want to this is my shauri now you know i want to go said macomber they sat under a tree and smoked want to go back and speak to the memsahib while we re waiting wilson asked no i ll just step back and tell her to be patient good said macomber he sat there sweating under his arms his mouth dry his stomach hollow feeling wanting to find courage to tell wilson to go on and finish off the lion without him he could not know that wilson was furious because he had not noticed the state he was in earlier and sent him back to his wife while he sat there wilson came up i have your big gun he said take it we ve given him time i think come on macomber took the big gun and wilson said keep behind me and about five yards to the right and do exactly as i tell you then he spoke in swahili to the two gun bearers who looked the picture of gloom let s go he said could i have a drink of water macomber asked wilson spoke to the older gun bearer who wore a canteen on his belt and the man unbuckled it unscrewed the top and handed it to macomber who took it noticing how heavy it seemed and how hairy and shoddy the felt covering was in his hand he raised it to drink and looked ahead at the high grass with the flat topped trees behind it a breeze was blowing toward them and the grass rippled gently in the wind he looked at the gun bearer and he could see the gun bearer was suffering too with fear thirty five yards into the grass the big lion lay flattened out along the ground his ears were back and his only movement was a slight twitching up and down of his long black tufted tail he had turned at bay as soon as he had reached this cover and he was sick with the wound through his full belly and weakening with the wound through his lungs that brought a thin foamy red to his mouth each time he breathed his flanks were wet and hot and flies were on the little openings the solid bullets had made in his tawny hide and his big yellow eyes narrowed with hate looked straight ahead only blinking when the pain came as he breathed and his claws dug in the soft baked earth all of him pain sickness hatred and all of his remaining strength was tightening into an absolute concentration for a rush he could hear the men talking and he waited gathering all of himself into this preparation for a charge as soon as the men would come into the grass as he heard their voices his tail stiffened to twitch up and down and as they came into the edge of the grass he made a coughing grunt and charged kongoni the old gun bearer in the lead watching the blood spoor wilson watching the grass for any movement his big gun ready the second gun bearer looking ahead and listening macomber close to wilson his rifle cocked they had just moved into the grass when macomber heard the bloodchoked coughing grunt and saw the swishing rush in the grass the next thing he knew he was running running wildly in panic in the open running toward the stream he heard the ca ra wong of wilson s big rifle and again in a second crashing carawong and turning saw the lion horrible looking now with half his head seeming to be gone crawling toward wilson in the edge of the tall grass while the red faced man worked the bolt on the short ugly rifle and aimed carefully as another blasting carawong came from the muzzle and the crawling heavy yellow bulk of the lion stiffened and the huge mutilated head slid forward and macomber standing by himself in the clearing where he had run holding a loaded rifle while two black men and a white man looked back at him in contempt knew the lion was dead he came toward wilson his tallness all seeming a naked reproach and wilson looked at him and said want to take pictures no he said that was all any one had said until they reached the motor car then wilson had said hell of a fine lion boys will skin him out we might as well stay here in the shade macomber s wife had not looked at him nor he at her and he had sat by her in the back seat with wilson sitting in the front seat once he had reached over and taken his wife s hand without looking at her and she had removed her hand from his looking across the stream to where the gun bearers were skinning out the lion he could see that she had been able to see the whole thing while they sat there his wife had reached forward and put her hand on wilson s shoulder he turned and she had leaned forward over the low seat and kissed him on the mouth oh i say said wilson going redder than his natural baked color mr robert wilson she said the beautiful red faced mr robert wilson then she sat down beside macomber again and looked away across the stream to where the lion lay with uplifted white muscled tendon marked naked forearms and white bloating belly as the black men fleshed away the skin finally the gun bearers brought the skin over wet and heavy and climbed in behind with it rolling it up before they got in and the motor car started no one had said anything more until they were back in camp that was the story of the lion macomber did not know how the lion had felt before he started his rush nor during it when the unbelievable smash of the 505 with a muzzle velocity of two tons had hit him in the mouth nor what kept him coming after that when the second ripping crash had smashed his hind quarters and he had come crawling on toward the crashing blasting thing that had destroyed him wilson knew something about it and only expressed it by saying damned fine lion but macomber did not know how wilson felt about things either he did not know how his wife felt except that she was through with him his wife had been through with him before but it never lasted he was very wealthy and would be much wealthier and he knew she would not leave him ever now that was one of the few things that he really knew he knew about that about motor cycles that was earliest about motor cars about duck shooting about fishing trout salmon and big sea about sex in books many books too many books about all court games about dogs not much about horses about hanging on to his money about most of the other things his world dealt in and about his wife not leaving him his wife had been a great beauty and she was still a great beauty in africa but she was not a great enough beauty any more at home to be able to leave him and better herself and she knew it and he knew it she had missed the chance to leave him and he knew it if he had been better with women she would probably have started to worry about him getting another new beautiful wife but she knew too much about him to worry about him either also he had always had a great tolerance which seemed the nicest thing about him if it were not the most sinister all in all they were known as a comparatively happily married couple one of those whose disruption is often rumored but never occurs and as the society columnist put it they were adding more than a spice of adventure to their much envied and ever enduring romance by a safari in what was known as darkest africa until the martin johnsons lighted it on so many silver screens where they were pursuing old simba the lion the buffalo tembo the elephant and as well collecting specimens for the museum of natural history this same columnist had reported them on the verge at least three times in the past and they had been but they always made it up they had a sound basis of union margot was too beautiful for macomber to divorce her and macomber had too much money for margot ever to leave him it was now about three o clock in the morning and francis macomber who had been asleep a little while after he had stopped thinking about the lion wakened and then slept again woke suddenly frightened in a dream of the bloody headed lion standing over him and listening while his heart pounded he realized that his wife was not in the other cot in the tent he lay awake with that knowledge for two hours at the end of that time his wife came into the tent lifted her mosquito bar and crawled cozily into bed where have you been macomber asked in the darkness hello she said are you awake where have you been i just went out to get a breath of air you did like hell what do you want me to say darling where have you been out to get a breath of air that s a new name for it you are a bitch well you re a coward all right he said what of it nothing as far as i m concerned but please let s not talk darling because i m very sleepy you think that i ll take anything i know you will sweet well i won t please darling let s not talk i m so very sleepy there wasn t going to be any of that you promised there wouldn t be well there is now she said sweetly you said if we made this trip that there would be none of that you promised yes darling that s the way i meant it to be but the trip was spoiled yesterday we don t have to talk about it do we you don t wait long when you have an advantage do you please let s not talk i m so sleepy darling i m going to talk don t mind me then because i m going to sleep and she did at breakfast they were all three at the table before daylight and francis macomber found that of all the many men that he had hated he hated robert wilson the most sleep well wilson asked in his throaty voice filling a pipe did you topping the white hunter told him you bastard thought macomber you insolent bastard so she woke him when she came in wilson thought looking at them both with his flat cold eyes well why doesn t he keep his wife where she belongs what does he think i am a bloody plaster saint let him keep her where she belongs it s his own fault do you think we ll find buffalo margot asked pushing away a dish of apricots chance of it wilson said and smiled at her why don t you stay in camp not for anything she told him why not order her to stay in camp wilson said to macomber you order her said macomber coldly let s not have any ordering nor turning to macomber any silliness francis margot said quite pleasantly are you ready to start macomber asked any time wilson told him do you want the memsahib to go does it make any difference whether i do or not the hell with it thought robert wilson the utter complete hell with it so this is what it s going to be like well this is what it s going to be like then makes no difference he said you re sure you wouldn t like to stay in camp with her yourself and let me go out and hunt the buffalo macomber asked can t do that said wilson wouldn t talk rot if i were you i m not talking rot i m disgusted bad word disgusted francis will you please try to speak sensibly his wife said i speak too damned sensibly macomber said did you ever eat such filthy food something wrong with the food asked wilson quietly no more than with everything else i d pull yourself together laddybuck wilson said very quietly there s a boy waits at table that understands a little english the hell with him wilson stood up and puffing on his pipe strolled away speaking a few words in swahili to one of the gun bearers who was standing waiting for him macomber and his wife sat on at the table he was staring at his coffee cup if you make a scene i ll leave you darling margot said quietly no you won t you can try it and see you won t leave me no she said i won t leave you and you ll behave your self behave myself that s a way to talk behave myself yes behave yourself why don t you try behaving i ve tried it so long so very long i hate that red faced swine macomber said i loathe the sight of him he s really very nice oh shut up macomber almost shouted just then the car came up and stopped in front of the dining tent and the driver and the two gunbearers got out wilson walked over and looked at the husband and wife sitting there at the table going shooting he asked yes said macomber standing up yes better bring a woolly it will be cool in the car wilson said i ll get my leather jacket margot said the boy has it wilson told her he climbed into the front with the driver and francis macomber and his wife sat not speaking in the back seat hope the silly beggar doesn t take a notion to blow the back of my head off wilson thought to himself women are a nuisance on safari the car was grinding down to cross the river at a pebbly ford in the gray daylight and then climbed angling up the steep bank where wilson had ordered a way shovelled out the day before so they could reach the parklike wooded rolling country on the far side it was a good morning wilson thought there was a heavy dew and as the wheels went through the grass and low bushes he could smell the odor of the crushed fronds it was an odor like verbena and he liked this early morning smell of the dew the crushed bracken and the look of the tree trunks showing black through the early morning mist as the car made its way through the untracked parklike country he had put the two in the back seat out of his mind now and was thinking about buffalo the buffalo that he was after stayed in the daytime in a thick swamp where it was impossible to get a shot but in the night they fed out into an open stretch of country and if he could come between them and their swamp with the car macomber would have a good chance at them in the open he did not want to hunt buff with macomber in thick cover he did not want to hunt buff or anything else with macomber at all but he was a professional hunter and he had hunted with some rare ones in his time if they got buff today there would only be rhino to come and the poor man would have gone through his dangerous game and things might pick up he d have nothing more to do with the woman and macomber would get over that too he must have gone through plenty of that before by the look of things poor beggar he must have a way of getting over it well it was the poor sod s own bloody fault he robert wilson carried a double size cot on safari to accommodate any windfalls he might receive he had hunted for a certain clientele the international fast sporting set where the women did not feel they were getting their money s worth unless they had shared that cot with the white hunter he despised them when he was away from them although he liked some of them well enough at the time but he made his living by them and their standards were his standards as long as they were hiring him they were his standards in all except the shooting he had his own standards about the killing and they could live up to them or get some one else to hunt them he knew too that they all respected him for this this macomber was an odd one though damned if he wasn t now the wife well the wife yes the wife hm the wife well he d dropped all that he looked around at them macomber sat grim and furious margot smiled at him she looked younger today more innocent and fresher and not so professionally beautiful what s in her heart god knows wilson thought she hadn t talked much last night at that it was a pleasure to see her the motor car climbed up a slight rise and went on through the trees and then out into a grassy prairie like opening and kept in the shelter of the trees along the edge the driver going slowly and wilson looking carefully out across the prairie and all along its far side he stopped the car and studied the opening with his field glasses then he motioned to the driver to go on and the car moved slowly along the driver avoiding warthog holes and driving around the mud castles ants had built then looking across the opening wilson suddenly turned and said by god there they are and looking where he pointed while the car jumped forward and wilson spoke in rapid swahili to the driver macomber saw three huge black animals looking almost cylindrical in their long heaviness like big black tank cars moving at a gallop across the far edge of the open prairie they moved at a stiff necked stiff bodied gallop and he could see the upswept wide black horns on their heads as they galloped heads out the heads not moving they re three old bulls wilson said we ll cut them off before they get to the swamp the car was going a wild forty five miles an hour across the open and as macomber watched the buffalo got bigger and bigger until he could see the gray hairless scabby look of one huge bull and how his neck was a part of his shoulders and the shiny black of his horns as he galloped a little behind the others that were strung out in that steady plunging gait and then the car swaying as though it had just jumped a road they drew up close and he could see the plunging hugeness of the bull and the dust in his sparsely haired hide the wide boss of horn and his outstretched wide nostrilled muzzle and he was raising his rifle when wilson shouted not from the car you fool and he had no fear only hatred of wilson while the brakes clamped on and the car skidded plowing sideways to an almost stop and wilson was out on one side and he on the other stumbling as his feet hit the still speeding by of the earth and then he was shooting at the bull as he moved away hearing the bullets whunk into him emptying his rifle at him as he moved steadily away finally remembering to get his shots forward into the shoulder and as he fumbled to re load he saw the bull was down down on his knees his big head tossing and seeing the other two still galloping he shot at the leader and hit him he shot again and missed and he heard the carawonging roar as wilson shot and saw the leading bull slide forward onto his nose get that other wilson said now you re shooting but the other bull was moving steadily at the same gallop and he missed throwing a spout of dirt and wilson missed and the dust rose in a cloud and wilson shouted come on he s too far and grabbed his arm and they were in the car again macomber and wilson hanging on the sides and rocketing swayingly over the uneven ground drawing up on the steady plunging heavy necked straight moving gallop of the bull they were behind him and macomber was filling his rifle dropping shells onto the ground jamming it clearing the jam then they were almost up with the bull when wilson yelled stop and the car skidded so that it almost swung over and macomber fell forward onto his feet slammed his bolt forward and fired as far forward as he could aim into the galloping rounded black back aimed and shot again then again then again and the bullets all of them hitting had no effect on the buffalo that he could see then wilson shot the roar deafening him and he could see the bull stagger macomber shot again aiming carefully and down he came onto his knees all right wilson said nice work that s the three macomber felt a drunken elation how many times did you shoot he asked just three wilson said you killed the first bull the biggest one i helped you finish the other two afraid they might have got into cover you had them killed i was just mopping up a little you shot damn well let s go to the car said macomber i want a drink got to finish off that buff first wilson told him the buffalo was on his knees and he jerked his head furiously and bellowed in pig eyed roaring rage as they came toward him watch he doesn t get up wilson said then get a little broadside and take him in the neck just behind the ear macomber aimed carefully at the center of the huge jerking rage driven neck and shot at the shot the head dropped forward that does it said wilson got the spine they re a hell of a looking thing aren t they let s get the drink said macomber in his life he had never felt so good in the car macomber s wife sat very white faced you were marvellous darling she said to macomber what a ride was it rough wilson asked it was frightful i ve never been more frightened in my life let s all have a drink macomber said by all means said wilson give it to the memsahib she drank the neat whisky from the flask and shuddered a little when she swallowed she handed the flask to macomber who handed it to wilson it was frightfully exciting she said it s given me a dreadful headache i didn t know you were allowed to shoot them from cars though no one shot from cars said wilson coldly i mean chase them from cars wouldn t ordinarily wilson said seemed sporting enough to me though while we were doing it taking more chance driving that way across the plain full of holes and one thing and another than hunting on foot buffalo could have charged us each time we shot if he liked gave him every chance wouldn t mention it to any one though it s illegal if that s what you mean it seemed very unfair to me margot said chasing those big helpless things in a motor car did it said wilson what would happen if they heard about it in nairobi i d lose my licence for one thing other unpleasantnesses wilson said taking a drink from the flask i d be out of business really yes really well said macomber and he smiled for the first time all day now she has something on you you have such a pretty way of putting things francis margot macomber said wilson looked at them both if a four letter man marries a five letter woman he was thinking what number of letters would their children be what he said was we lost a gun bearer did you notice it my god no macomber said here he comes wilson said he s all right he must have fallen off when we left the first bull approaching them was the middle aged gun bearer limping along in his knitted cap khaki tunic shorts and rubber sandals gloomy faced and disgusted looking as he came up he called out to wilson in swahili and they all saw the change in the white hunter s face what does he say asked margot he says the first bull got up and went into the bush wilson said with no expression in his voice oh said macomber blankly then it s going to be just like the lion said margot rull of anticipation it s not going to be a damned bit like the lion wilson told her did you want another drink macomber thanks yes macomber said he expected the feeling he had had about the lion to come back but it did not for the first time in his life he really felt wholly without fear instead of fear he had a feeling of definite elation we ll go and have a look at the second bull wilson said i ll tell the driver to put the car in the shade what are you going to do asked margaret macomber take a look at the buff wilson said i ll come come along the three of them walked over to where the second buffalo bulked blackly in the open head forward on the grass the massive horns swung wide he s a very good head wilson said that s dose to a fifty inch spread macomber was looking at him with delight he s hateful looking said margot can t we go into the shade of course wilson said look he said to macomber and pointed see that patch of bush yes that s where the first bull went in the gun bearer said when he fell off the bull was down he was watching us helling along and the other two buff galloping when he looked up there was the bull up and looking at him gun bearer ran like hell and the bull went off slowly into that bush can we go in after him now asked macomber eagerly wilson looked at him appraisingly damned if this isn t a strange one he thought yesterday he s scared sick and today he s a ruddy fire eater no we ll give him a while let s please go into the shade margot said her face was white and she looked ill they made their way to the car where it stood under a single wide spreading tree and all climbed in chances are he s dead in there wilson remarked after a little we ll have a look macomber felt a wild unreasonable happiness that he had never known before by god that was a chase he said i ve never felt any such feeling wasn t it marvellous margot i hated it why i hated it she said bitterly i loathed it you know i don t think i d ever be afraid of anything again macomber said to wilson something happened in me after we first saw the buff and started after him like a dam bursting it was pure excitement cleans out your liver said wilson damn funny things happen to people macomber s face was shining you know something did happen to me he said i feel absolutely different his wife said nothing and eyed him strangely she was sitting far back in the seat and macomber was sitting forward talking to wilson who turned sideways talking over the back of the front seat you know i d like to try another lion macomber said i m really not afraid of them now after all what can they do to you that s it said wilson worst one can do is kill you how does it go shakespeare damned good see if i can remember oh damned good used to quote it to myself at one time let s see by my troth i care not a man can die but once we owe god a death and let it go which way it will he that dies this year is quit for the next damned fine eh he was very embarrassed having brought out this thing he had lived by but he had seen men come of age before and it always moved him it was not a matter of their twenty first birthday it had taken a strange chance of hunting a sudden precipitation into action without opportunity for worrying beforehand to bring this about with macomber but regardless of how it had happened it had most certainly happened look at the beggar now wilson thought it s that some of them stay little boys so long wilson thought sometimes all their lives their figures stay boyish when they re fifty the great american boy men damned strange people but he liked this macomber now damned strange fellow probably meant the end of cuckoldry too well that would be a damned good thing damned good thing beggar had probably been afraid all his life don t know what started it but over now hadn t had time to be afraid with the buff that and being angry too motor car too motor cars made it familiar be a damn fire eater now he d seen it in the war work the same way more of a change than any loss of virginity fear gone like an operation something else grew in its place main thing a man had made him into a man women knew it too no bloody fear from the far corner of the seat margaret macomber looked at the two of them there was no change in wilson she saw wilson as she had seen him the day before when she had first realized what his great talent was but she saw the change in francis macomber now do you have that feeling of happiness about what s going to happen macomber asked still exploring his new wealth you re not supposed to mention it wilson said looking in the other s face much more fashionable to say you re scared mind you you ll be scared too plenty of times but you have a feeling of happiness about action to come yes said wilson there s that doesn t do to talk too much about all this talk the whole thing away no pleasure in anything if you mouth it up too much you re both talking rot said margot just because you ve chased some helpless animals in a motor car you talk like heroes sorry said wilson i have been gassing too much she s worried about it already he thought if you don t know what we re talking about why not keep out of it macomber asked his wife you ve gotten awfully brave awfully suddenly his wife said contemptuously but her contempt was not secure she was very afraid of something macomber laughed a very natural hearty laugh you know i have he said i really have isn t it sort of late margot said bitterly because she had done the best she could for many years back and the way they were together now was no one person s fault not for me said macomber margot said nothing but sat back in the corner of the seat do you think we ve given him time enough macomber asked wilson cheerfully we might have a look wilson said have you any solids left the gun bearer has some wilson called in swahili and the older gun bearer who was skinning out one of the heads straightened up pulled a box of solids out of his pocket and brought them over to macomber who filled his magazine and put the remaining shells in his pocket you might as well shoot the springfield wilson said you re used to it we ll leave the mannlicher in the car with the memsahib your gun bearer can carry your heavy gun i ve this damned cannon now let me tell you about them he had saved this until the last because he did not want to worry macomber when a buff comes he comes with his head high and thrust straight out the boss of the horns covers any sort of a brain shot the only shot is straight into the nose the only other shot is into his chest or if you re to one side into the neck or the shoulders after they ve been hit once they take a hell of a lot of killing don t try anything fancy take the easiest shot there is they ve finished skinning out that head now should we get started he called to the gun bearers who came up wiping their hands and the older one got into the back i ll only take kongoni wilson said the other can watch to keep the birds away as the car moved slowly across the open space toward the island of brushy trees that ran in a tongue of foliage along a dry water course that cut the open swale macomber felt his heart pounding and his mouth was dry again but it was excitement not fear here s where he went in wilson said then to the gun bearer in swahili take the blood spoor the car was parallel to the patch of bush macomber wilson and the gun bearer got down macomber looking back saw his wife with the rifle by her side looking at him he waved to her and she did not wave back the brush was very thick ahead and the ground was dry the middle aged gun bearer was sweating heavily and wilson had his hat down over his eyes and his red neck showed just ahead of macomber suddenly the gun bearer said something in swahili to wilson and ran forward he s dead in there wilson said good work and he turned to grip macomber s hand and as they shook hands grinning at each other the gun bearer shouted wildly and they saw him coming out of the bush sideways fast as a crab and the bull coming nose out mouth tight closed blood dripping massive head straight out coming in a charge his little pig eyes bloodshot as he looked at them wilson who was ahead was kneeling shooting and macomber as he fired unhearing his shot in the roaring of wilson s gun saw fragments like slate burst from the huge boss of the horns and the head jerked he shot again at the wide nostrils and saw the horns jolt again and fragments fly and he did not see wilson now and aiming carefully shot again with the buffalo s huge bulk almost on him and his rifle almost level with the on coming head nose out and he could see the little wicked eyes and the head started to lower and he felt a sudden white hot blinding flash explode inside his head and that was all he ever felt wilson had ducked to one side to get in a shoulder shot macomber had stood solid and shot for the nose shooting a touch high each time and hitting the heavy horns splintering and chipping them like hitting a slate roof and mrs macomber in the car had shot at the buffalo with the 6 5 mannlicher as it seemed about to gore macomber and had hit her husband about two inches up and a little to one side of the base of his skull francis macomber lay now face down not two yards from where the buffalo lay on his side and his wife knelt over him with wilson beside her i wouldn t turn him over wilson said the woman was crying hysterically i d get back in the car wilson said where s the rifle she shook her head her face contorted the gun bearer picked up the rifle leave it as it is said wilson then go get abdulla so that he may witness the manner of the accident he knelt down took a handkerchief from his pocket and spread it over francis macomber s crew cropped head where it lay the blood sank into the dry loose earth wilson stood up and saw the buffalo on his side his legs out his thinly haired belly crawling with ticks hell of a good bull his brain registered automatically a good fifty inches or better better he called to the driver and told him to spread a blanket over the body and stay by it then he walked over to the motor car where the woman sat crying in the corner that was a pretty thing to do he said in a toneless voice he would have left you too stop it she said of course it s an accident he said i know that stop it she said don t worry he said there will be a certain amount of unpleasantness but i will have some photographs taken that will be very useful at the inquest there s the testimony of the gun bearers and the driver too you re perfectly all right stop it she said there s a hell of a lot to be done he said and i ll have to send a truck off to the lake to wireless for a plane to take the three of us into nairobi why didn t you poison him that s what they do in england stop it stop it stop it the woman cried wilson looked at her with his flat blue eyes i m through now he said i was a little angry i d begun to like your husband oh please stop it she said please stop it that s better wilson said please is much better now i ll stop the capital of the world madrid is full of boys named paco which is the diminutive of the name francisco and there is a madrid joke about a father who came to madrid and inserted an advertisement in the personal columns of el liberal which said paco meet me at hotel montana noon tuesday all is forgiven papa and how a squadron of guardia civil had to be called out to disperse the eight hundred young men who answered the advertisement but this paco who waited on table at the pension luarca had no father to forgive him nor anything for the father to forgive he had two older sisters who were chambermaids at the luarca who had gotten their place through coming from the same small village as a former luarca chambermaid who had proven hardworking and honest and hence given her village and its products a good name and these sisters had paid his way on the auto bus to madrid and gotten him his job as an apprentice waiter he came from a village in a part of extramadura where conditions were incredibly primitive food scarce and comforts unknown and he had worked hard ever since he could remember he was a well built boy with very black rather curly hair good teeth and a skin that his sisters envied and he had a ready and unpuzzled smile he was fast on his feet and did his work well and he loved his sisters who seemed beautiful and sophisticated he loved madrid which was still an unbelievable place and he loved his work which done under bright lights with clean linen the wearing of evening clothes and abundant food in the kitchen seemed romantically beautiful there were from eight to a dozen other people who lived at the luarca and ate in the dining room but for paco the youngest of the three waiters who served at table the only ones who really existed were the bullfighters second rate matadors lived at that pension because the address in the calle san jeronimo was good the food was excellent and the room and board was cheap it is necessary for a bull fighter to give the appearance if not of prosperity at least of respectability since decorum and dignity rank above courage as the virtues most highly prized in spain and bullfighters stayed at the luarca until their last pesetas were gone there is no record of any bullfighter having left the luarca for a better or more expensive hotel second rate bullfighters never became first rate but the descent from the luarca was swift since any one could stay there who was making anything at all and a bill was never presented to a guest unasked until the woman who ran the place knew that the case was hopeless at this time there were three full matadors living at the luarca as well as two very good picadors and one excellent banderillero the luarca was luxury for the picadors and the banderilleros who with their families in seville required lodging in madrid during the spring season but they were well paid and in the fixed employ of fighters who were heavily contracted during the coming season and the three of these subalterns would probably make much more apiece than any of the three matadors of the three matadors one was ill and trying to conceal it one had passed his short vogue as a novelty and the third was a coward the coward had at one time until he had received a peculiarly atrocious horn wound in the lower abdomen at the start of his first season as a full matador been exceptionally brave and remarkably skillful and he still had many of the hearty mannerisms of his days of success he was jovial to excess and laughed constantly with and without provocation he had when successful been very addicted to practical jokes but he had given them up now they took an assurance that he did not feel this matador had an intelligent very open face and he carried himself with much style the matador who was ill was careful never to show it and was meticulous about eating a little of all the dishes that were presented at the table he had a great many handkerchiefs which he laundered himself in his room and lately he had been selling his fighting suits he had sold one cheaply before christmas and another in the first week of april they had been very expensive suits had always been well kept and he had one more before he had become ill he had been a very promising even a sensational fighter and while he himself could not read he had clippings which said that in his debut in madrid he had been better than belmonte he ate alone at a small table and looked up very little the matador who had once been a novelty was very short and brown and very dignified he also ate alone at a separate table and he smiled very rarely and never laughed he came from valladolid where the people are extremely serious and he was a capable matador but his style had become oldfashioned before he had ever succeeded in endearing himself to the public through his virtues which were courage and a calm capability and his name on a poster would draw no one to a bull ring his novelty had been that he was so short that he could barely see over the bull s withers but there were other short fighters and he had never succeeded in imposing himself on the public s fancy of the picadors one was a thin hawk faced gray haired man lightly built but with legs and arms like iron who always wore cattlemen s boots under his trousers drank too much every evening and gazed amorously at any woman in the pension the other was huge dark brown faced good looking with black hair like an indian and enormous hands both were great picadors although the first was reputed to have lost much of his ability through drink and dissipation and the second was said to be too headstrong and quarrelsome to stay with any matador more than a single season the banderillero was middle aged gray cat quick in spite of his years and sitting at the table he looked a moderately prosperous business man his legs were still good for this season and when they should go he was intelligent and experienced enough to keep regularly employed for a long time the difference would be that when his speed of foot would be gone he would always be frightened where now he was assured and calm in the ring and out of it on this evening every one had left the dining room except the hawk faced picador who drank too much the birthmarked faced auctioneer of watches at the fairs and festivals of spain who also drank too much and two priests from galicia who were sitting at a corner table and drinking if not too much certainly enough at that time wine was included in the price of the room and board at the luarca and the waiters had just brought fresh bottles of valdepeñas to the tables of the auctioneer then to the picador and finally to the two priests the three waiters stood at the end of the room it was the rule of the house that they should all remain on duty until the diners whose tables they were responsible for should all have left but the one who served the table of the two priests had an appointment to go to an anarcho syndicalist meeting and paco had agreed to take over his table for him upstairs the matador who was ill was lying face down on his bed alone the matador who was no longer a novelty was sitting looking out of his window preparatory to walking out to the café the matador who was a coward had the older sister of paco in his room with him and was trying to get her to do something which she was laughingly refusing to do this matador was saying come on little savage no said the sister why should i for a favor you ve eaten and now you want me for dessert just once what harm can it do leave me alone leave me alone i tell you it is a very little thing to do leave me alone i tell you down in the dining room the tallest of the waiters who was overdue at the meeting said look at those black pigs drink that s no way to speak said the second waiter they are decent clients they do not drink too much for me it is a good way to speak said the tall one there are the two curses of spain the bulls and the priests certainly not the individual bull and the individual priest said the second waiter yes said the tall waiter only through the individual can you attack the class it is necessary to kill the individual bull and the individual priest all of them then there are no more save it for the meeting said the other waiter look at the barbarity of madrid said the tall waiter it is now half past eleven o clock and these are still guzzling they only started to eat at ten said the other waiter as you know there are many dishes that wine is cheap and these have paid for it it is not a strong wine how can there be solidarity of workers with fools like you asked the tall waiter look said the second waiter who was a man of fifty i have worked all my life in all that remains of my life i must work i have no complaints against work to work is normal yes but the lack of work kills i have always worked said the older waiter go on to the meeting there is no necessity to stay you are a good comrade said the tall waiter but you lack all ideology mejor si me falta eso que el otro said the older waiter meaning it is better to lack that than work go on to the mitin paco had said nothing he did not yet understand politics but it always gave him a thrill to hear the tall waiter speak of the necessity for killing the priests and the guardia civil the tall waiter represented to him revolution and revolution also was romantic he himself would like to be a good catholic a revolutionary and have a steady job like this while at the same time being a bullfighter go on to the meeting ignacio he said i will respond for your work the two of us said the older waiter there isn t enough for one said paco go on to the meeting pues me voy said the tall waiter and thanks in the meantime upstairs the sister of paco had gotten out of the embrace of the matador as skilfully as a wrestler breaking a hold and said now angry these are the hungry people a failed bullfighter with your ton load of fear if you have so much of that use it in the ring that is the way a whore talks a whore is also a woman but i am not a whore you ll be one not through you leave me said the matador who now repulsed and refused felt the nakedness of his cowardice returning leave you what hasn t left you said the sister don t you want me to make up the bed i m paid to do that leave me said the matador his broad good looking face wrinkled into a contortion that was like crying you whore you dirty little whore matador she said shutting the door my matador inside the room the matador sat on the bed his face still had the contortion which in the ring he made into a constant smile which frightened those people in the first rows of seats who knew what they were watching and this he was saying aloud and this and this he could remember when he had been good and it had only been three years before he could remember the weight of the heavy gold brocaded fighting jacket on his shoulders on that hot afternoon in may when his voice had still been the same in the ring as in the cafe and how he sighted along the point dipping blade at the place in the top of the shoulders where it was dusty in the short haired black hump of muscle above the wide wood knocking splintered tipped horns that lowered as he went in to kill and how the sword pushed in as easy as into a mound of stiff butter with the palm of his hand pushing the pommel his left arm crossed low his left shoulder forward his weight on his left leg and then his weight wasn t on his leg his weight was on his lower belly and as the bull raised his head the horn was out of sight in him and he swung over on it twice before they pulled him off it so now when he went into kill and it was seldom he could not look at the horns and what did any whore know about what he went through before be fought and what had they been through that laughed at him they were all whores and they knew what they could do with it down in the dining room the picador sat looking at the priests if there were women in the room he stared at them if there were no women he would stare with enjoyment at a foreigner un inglés but lacking women or strangers he now stared with enjoyment and insolence at the two priests while he stared the birth marked auctioneer rose and folding his napkin went out leaving over half the wine in the last bottle he had ordered if his accounts had been paid up at the luarca he would have finished the bottle the two priests did not stare back at the picador one of them was saying it is ten days since i have been here waiting to see him and all day i sit in the ante chamber and he will not receive me what is there to do nothing what can one do one cannot go against authority i have been here for two weeks and nothing i wait and they will not see me we are from the abandoned country when the money runs out we can return to the abandoned country what does madrid care about galicia we are a poor province one understands the action of our brother basilio still i have no real confidence in the integrity of basilio alvarez madrid is where one learns to understand madrid kills spain if they would simply see one and refuse no you must be broken and worn out by waiting well we shall see i can wait as well as another at this moment the picador got to his feet walked over to the priests table and stood grayheaded and hawk faced staring at them and smiling a torero said one priest to the other and a good one said the picador and walked out of the dining room gray jacketed trimwaisted bow legged in tight breeches over his high heeled cattlemen s boots that clicked on the floor as he swaggered quite steadily smiling to himself he lived in a small tight professional world of personal efficiency nightly alcoholic triumph and insolence now he lit a cigar and tilting his hat at an angle in the hallway went out to the café the priests left immediately after the picador hurriedly conscious of being the last people in the dining room and there was no one in the room now but paco and the middle aged waiter they cleared the tables and carried the bottles into the kitchen in the kitchen was the boy who washed the dishes he was three years older than paco and was very cynical and bitter take this the middle aged waiter said and poured out a glass of the valdepeñas and handed it to him why not the boy took the glass tu paco the older waiter asked thank you said paco the three of them drank i will be going said the middle aged waiter good night they told him he went out and they were alone paco took a napkin one of the priests had used and standing straight his heels planted lowered the napkin and with head following the movement swung his arms in the motion of a slow sweeping verónica he turned and advancing his right foot slightly made the second pass gained a little terrain on the imaginary bull and made a third pass slow perfectly timed and suave then gathered the napkin to his waist and swung his hips away from the bull in a mediaverónica the dishwasher whose name was enrique watched him critically and sneeringly how is the bull he said very brave said paco look standing slim and straight he made four more perfect passes smooth elegant and graceful and the bull asked enrique standing against the sink holding his wine glass and wearing his apron still has lots of gas said paco you make me sick said enrique why look enrique removed his apron and citing the imaginary bull he sculptured four perfect languid gypsy verónicas and ended up with a rebolera that made the apron swing in a stiff arc past the bull s nose as he walked away from him look at that he said and i wash dishes why fear said enrique miedo the same fear you would have in a ring with a bull no said paco i wouldn t be afraid leche said enrique every one is afraid but a torero can control his fear so that he can work the bull i went in an amateur fight and i was so afraid i couldn t keep from running every one thought it was very funny so would you be afraid if it wasn t for fear every bootblack in spain would be a bullfighter you a country boy would be frightened worse than i was no said paco he had done it too many times in his imagination too many times he had seen the horns seen the bull s wet muzzle the ear twitching then the head go down and the charge the hoofs thudding and the hot bull pass him as he swung the cape to re charge as he swung the cape again then again and again and again to end winding the bull around him in his great media verónica and walk swingingly away with bull hairs caught in the gold ornaments of his jacket from the close passes the bull standing hypnotized and the crowd applauding no he would not be afraid others yes not he he knew he would not be afraid even if he ever was afraid he knew that he could do it anyway he had confidence i wouldn t be afraid he said enrique said leche again then he said if we should try it how look said enrique you think of the bull but you do not think of the horns the bull has such force that the horns rip like a knife they stab like a bayonet and they kill like a club look he opened a table drawer and took out two meat knives i will bind these to the legs of a chair then i will play bull for you with the chair held before my head the knives are the horns if you make those passes then they mean something lend me your apron said paco we ll do it in the dining room no said enrique suddenly not bitter don t do it paco yes said paco i m not afraid you will be when you see the knives come we ll see said paco give me the apron at this time while enrique was binding the two heavy bladed razor sharp meat knives fast to the legs of the chair with two soiled napkins holding the half of each knife wrapping them tight and then knotting them the two chambermaids paco s sisters were on their way to the cinema to see greta garbo in anna christie of the two priests one was sitting in his underwear reading his breviary and the other was wearing a nightshirt and saying the rosary all the bullfighters except the one who was ill had made their evening appearance at the café fornos where the big dark haired picador was playing billiards the short serious matador was sitting at a crowded table before a coffee and milk along with the middle aged banderillero and other serious workmen the drinking gray headed picador was sitting with a glass of cazalas brandy before him staring with pleasure at a table where the matador whose courage was gone sat with another matador who had renounced the sword to become a banderillero again and two very houseworn looking prostitutes the auctioneer stood on the street corner talking with friends the tall waiter was at the anarcho syndicalist meeting waiting for an opportunity to speak the middle aged waiter was seated on the terrace of the café alvarez drinking a small beer the woman who owned the luarca was already asleep in her bed where she lay on her back with the bolster between her legs big fat honest clean easy going very religious and never having ceased to miss or pray daily for her husband dead now twenty years in his room alone the matador who was ill lay face down on his bed with his mouth against a handkerchief now in the deserted dining room enrique tied the last knot in the napkins that bound the knives to the chair legs and lifted the chair he pointed the legs with the knives on them forward and held the chair over his head with the two knives pointing straight ahead one on each side of his head it s heavy he said look paco it is very dangerous don t do it he was sweating paco stood facing him holding the apron spread holding a fold of it bunched in each hand thumbs up first finger down spread to catch the eye of the bull charge straight he said turn like a bull charge as many times as you want how will you know when to cut the pass asked enrique it s better to do three and then a media all right said paco but come straight huh torito come on little bull running with head down enrique came toward him and paco swung the apron just ahead of the knife blade as it passed close in front of his belly and as it went by it was to him the real horn white tipped black smooth and as enrique passed him and turned to rush again it was the hot blood flanked mass of the bull that thudded by then turned like a cat and came again as he swung the cape slowly then the bull turned and came again and as he watched the onrushing point he stepped his left foot two inches too far forward and the knife did not pass but had slipped in as easily as into a wineskin and there was a hot scalding rush above and around the sudden inner rigidity of steel and enrique shouting ay ay let me get it out let me get it out and paco slipped forward on the chair the apron cape still held enrique pulling on the chair as the knife turned in him in him paco the knife was out now and he sat on the floor in the widening warm pool put the napkin over it hold it said enrique hold it tight i will run for the doctor you must hold in the hemorrhage there should be a rubber cup said paco he had seen that used in the ring i came straight said enrique crying all i wanted was to show the danger don t worry said paco his voice sounding far away but bring the doctor in the ring they lifted you and carried you running with you to the operating room if the femoral artery emptied itself before you reached there they called the priest advise one of the priests said paco holding the napkin tight against his lower abdomen he could not believe that this had happened to him but enrique was running down the calle san jerónimo to the all night first aid station and paco was alone first sitting up then huddled over then slumped on the floor until it was over feeling his life go out of him as dirty water empties from a bathtub when the plug is drawn he was frightened and he felt faint and he tried to say an act of contrition and he remembered how it started but before he had said as fast as he could oh my god i am heartily sorry for having offended thee who art worthy of all my love and i firmly resolve he felt too faint and he was lying face down on the floor and it was over very quickly a severed femoral artery empties itself faster than you can believe as the doctor from the first aid station came up the stairs accompanied by a policeman who held on to enrique by the arm the two sisters of paco were still in the moving picture palace of the gran via where they were intensely disappointed in the garbo film which showed the great star in miserable low surroundings when they had been accustomed to see her surrounded by great luxury and brilliance the audience disliked the film thoroughly and were protesting by whistling and stamping their feet all the other people from the hotel were doing almost what they had been doing when the accident happened except that the two priests had finished their devotions and were preparing for sleep and the gray haired picador had moved his drink over to the table with the two houseworn prostitutes a little later he went out of the café with one of them it was the one for whom the matador who had lost his nerve had been buying drinks the boy paco had never known about any of this nor about what all these people would be doing on the next day and on other days to come he had no idea how they really lived nor how they ended he did not even realize they ended he died as the spanish phrase has it full of illusions he had not had time in his life to lose any of them nor even at the end to complete an act of contrition he had not even had time to be disappointed in the garbo picture which disappointed all madrid for a week kilimanjaro is a snow covered mountain 19 710 feet high and is said to be the highest mountain in africa its western summit is called the masai ngàje naài the house of god close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard no one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude the snows of kilimanjaro the marvellous thing is that it s painless he said that s how you know when it starts is it really absolutely i m awfully sorry about the odor though that must bother you don t please don t look at them he said now is it sight or is it scent that brings them like that the cot the man lay on was in the wide shade of a mimosa tree and as he looked out past the shade onto the glare of the plain there were three of the big birds squatted obscenely while in the sky a dozen more sailed making quick moving shadows as they passed they ve been there since the day the truck broke down he said today s the first time any have lit on the ground i watched the way they sailed very carefully at first in case i ever wanted to use them in a story that s funny now i wish you wouldn t she said i m only talking he said it s much easier if i talk but i don t want to bother you you know it doesn t bother me she said it s that i ve gotten so very nervous not being able to do anything i think we might make it as easy as we can until the plane comes or until the plane doesn t come please tell me what i can do there must be something i can do you can take the leg off and that might stop it though i doubt it or you can shoot me you re a good shot now i taught you to shoot didn t i please don t talk that way couldn t i read to you read what anything in the book bag that we haven t read i can t listen to it he said talking is the easiest we quarrel and that makes the time pass i don t quarrel i never want to quarrel let s not quarrel any more no matter how nervous we get maybe they will be back with another truck today maybe the plane will come i don t want to move the man said there is no sense in moving now except to make it easier for you that s cowardly can t you let a man die as comfortably as he can without calling him names what s the use of slanging me you re not going to die don t be silly i m dying now ask those bastards he looked over to where the huge filthy birds sat their naked heads sunk in the hunched feathers a fourth planed down to run quick legged and then waddle slowly toward the others they are around every camp you never notice them you can t die if you don t give up where did you read that you re such a bloody fool you might think about some one else for christ s sake he said that s been my trade he lay then and was quiet for a while and looked across the heat shimmer of the plain to the edge of the bush there were a few tommies that showed minute and white against the yellow and far off he saw a herd of zebra white against the green of the bush this was a pleasant camp under big trees against a hill with good water and close by a nearly dry water hole where sand grouse flighted in the mornings wouldn t you like me to read she asked she was sitting on a canvas chair beside his cot there s a breeze coming up no thanks maybe the truck will come i don t give a damn about the truck i do you give a damn about so many things that i don t not so many harry what about a drink it s supposed to be bad for you it said in black s to avoid all alcohol you shouldn t drink molo he shouted yes bwana bring whiskey soda yes bwana you shouldn t she said that s what i mean by giving up it says it s bad for you i know it s bad for you no he said it s good for me so now it was all over he thought so now he would never have a chance to finish it so this was the way it ended in a bickering over a drink since the gangrene started in his right leg he had no pain and with the pain the horror had gone and all he felt now was a great tiredness and anger that this was the end of it for this that now was coming he had very little curiosity for years it had obsessed him but now it meant nothing in itself it was strange how easy being tired enough made it now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well well he would not have to fail at trying to write them either maybe you could never write them and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting well he would never know now i wish we d never come the woman said she was looking at him holding the glass and biting her lip you never would have gotten anything like this in paris you always said you loved paris we could have stayed in paris or gone anywhere i d have gone anywhere i said i d go anywhere you wanted if you wanted to shoot we could have gone shooting in hungary and been comfortable your bloody money he said that s not fair she said it was always yours as much as mine i left everything and i went wherever you wanted to go and i ve done what you wanted to do but i wish we d never come here you said you loved it i did when you were all right but now i hate it i don t see why that had to happen to your leg what have we done to have that happen to us i suppose what i did was to forget to put iodine on it when i first scratched it then i didn t pay any attention to it because i never infect then later when it got bad it was probably using that weak carbolic solution when the other antiseptics ran out that paralyzed the minute blood vessels and started the gangrene he looked at her what else i don t mean that if we would have hired a good mechanic instead of a half baked kikuyu driver he would have checked the oil and never burned out that bearing in the truck i don t mean that if you hadn t left your own people your goddamned old westbury saratoga palm beach people to take me on why i loved you that s not fair i love you now i ll always love you don t you love me no said the man i don t think so i never have harry what are you saying you re out of your head no i haven t any head to go out of don t drink that she said darling please don t drink that we have to do everything we can you do it he said i m tired now in his mind he saw a railway station at karagatch and he was standing with his pack and that was the headlight of the simplon orient cutting the dark now and he was leaving thrace then after the retreat that was one of the things he had saved to write with in the morning at breakfast looking out the window and seeing snow on the mountains in bulgaria and nansen s secretary asking the old man if it were snow and the old man looking at it and saying no that s not snow it s too early for snow and the secretary repeating to the other girls no you see it s not snow and them all saying it s not snow we were mistaken but it was the snow all right and he sent them on into it when he evolved exchange of populations and it was snow they tramped along in until they died that winter it was snow too that fell all christmas week that year up in the gauertal that year they lived in the woodcutter s house with the big square porcelain stove that filled half the room and they slept on mattresses filled with beech leaves the time the deserter came with his feet bloody in the snow he said the police were right behind him and they gave him woolen socks and held the gendarmes talking until the tracks had drifted over in schrunz on christmas day the snow was so bright it hurt your eyes when you looked out from the weinstube and saw every one coming home from church that was where they walked up the sleigh smoothed urine yellowed road along the river with the steep pine hills skis heavy on the shoulder and where they ran that great run down the glacier above the madlener haus the snow as smooth to see as cake frosting and as light as powder and he remembered the noiseless rush the speed made as you dropped down like a bird they were snow bound a week in the madlener haus that time in the blizzard playing cards in the smoke by the lantern light and the stakes were higher all the time as herr lent lost more finally he lost it all everything the skischule money and all the season s profit and then his capital he could see him with his long nose picking up the cards and then opening sans voir there was always gambling then when there was no snow you gambled and when there was too much you gambled he thought of all the time in his life he had spent gambling but he had never written a line of that nor of that cold bright christmas day with the mountains showing across the plain that barker had flown across the lines to bomb the austrian of icers leave train machine gunning them as they scattered and ran he remembered barker afterwards coming into the mess and starting to tell about it and how quiet it got and then somebody saying you bloody murderous bastard those were the same austrians they killed then that he skied with later no not the same hans that he skied with all that year had been in the kaiser jägers and when they went hunting hares together up the little valley above the saw mill they had talked of the fighting on pasubio and of the attack on perticara and asalone and he had never written a word of that nor of monte corona nor the sette communi nor of arsiero how many winters had he lived in the vorarlberg and the arlberg it was four and then he remembered the man who had the fox to sell when they had walked into bludenz that time to buy presents and the cherry pit taste of good kirsch the fast slipping rush of running powder snow on crust singing hi ho said rolly as you ran down the last stretch to the steep drop taking it straight then running the orchard in three turns and out across the ditch and onto the icy road behind the inn knocking your bindings loose kicking the skis free and leaning them up against the wooden wall of the inn the lamplight coming from the window where inside in the smoky new wine smelling warmth they were playing the accordion where did we stay in paris he asked the woman who was sitting by him in a canvas chair now in africa at the crillon you know that why do i know that that s where we always stayed no not always there and at the pavillion henri quatre in st germain you said you loved it there love is a dunghill said harry and i m the cock that gets on it to crow if you have to go away she said is it absolutely necessary to kill off everything you leave behind i mean do you have to take away everything do you have to kill your horse and your wife and burn your saddle and your armour yes he said your damned money was my armour my swift and my armour don t all right i ll stop that i don t want to hurt you it s a little bit late now all right then i ll go on hurting you it s more amusing the only thing i ever really liked to do with you i can t do now no that s not true you liked to do many things and everything you wanted to do i did oh for christ sake stop bragging will you he looked at her and saw her crying listen he said do you think that it is fun to do this i don t know why i m doing it it s trying to kill to keep yourself alive i imagine i was all right when we started talking i didn t mean to start this and now i m crazy as a coot and being as cruel to you as i can be don t pay any attention darling to what i say i love you really you know i love you i ve never loved any one else the way i love you he slipped into the familiar lie he made his bread and butter by you re sweet to me you bitch he said you rich bitch that s poetry i m full of poetry now rot and poetry rotten poetry stop it harry why do you have to turn into a devil now i don t like to leave anything the man said i don t like to leave things behind it was evening now and he had been asleep the sun was gone behind the hill and there was a shadow all across the plain and the small animals were feeding close to camp quick dropping heads and switching tails he watched them keeping well out away from the bush now the birds no longer waited on the ground they were all perched heavily in a tree there were many more of them his personal boy was sitting by the bed memsahib s gone to shoot the boy said does bwana want nothing she had gone to kill a piece of meat and knowing how he liked to watch the game she had gone well away so she would not disturb this little pocket of the plain that he could see she was always thoughtful he thought on anything she knew about or had read or that she had ever heard it was not her fault that when he went to her he was already over how could a woman know that you meant nothing that you said that you spoke only from habit and to be comfortable after he no longer meant what he said his lies were more successful with women than when he had told them the truth it was not so much that he lied as that there was no truth to tell he had had his life and it was over and then he went on living it again with different people and more money with the best of the same places and some new ones you kept from thinking and it was all marvellous you were equipped with good insides so that you did not go to pieces that way the way most of them had and you made an attitude that you cared nothing for the work you used to do now that you could no longer do it but in yourself you said that you would write about these people about the very rich that you were really not of them but a spy in their country that you would leave it and write of it and for once it would be written by some one who knew what he was writing of but he would never do it because each day of not writing of comfort of being that which he despised dulled his ability and softened his will to work so that finally he did no work at all the people he knew now were all much more comfortable when he did not work africa was where he had been happiest in the good time of his life so he had come out here to start again they had made this safari with the minimum of comfort there was no hardship but there was no luxury and he had thought that he could get back into training that way that in some way he could work the fat off his soul the way a fighter went into the mountains to work and train in order to bum it out of his body she had liked it she said she loved it she loved anything that was exciting that involved a change of scene where there were new people and where things were pleasant and he had felt the illusion of returning strength of will to work now if this was how it ended and he knew it was he must not turn like some snake biting itself because its back was broken it wasn t this woman s fault if it had not been she it would have been another if he lived by a lie he should try to die by it he heard a shot beyond the hill she shot very well this good this rich bitch this kindly caretaker and destroyer of his talent nonsense he had destroyed his talent himself why should he blame this woman because she kept him well he had destroyed his talent by not using it by betrayals of himself and what he believed in by drinking so much that he blunted the edge of his perceptions by laziness by sloth and by snobbery by pride and by prejudice by hook and by crook what was this a catalogue of old books what was his talent anyway it was a talent all right but instead of using it he had traded on it it was never what he had done but always what he could do and he had chosen to make his living with something else instead of a pen or a pencil it was strange too wasn t it that when he fell in love with another woman that woman should always have more money than the last one but when he no longer was in love when he was only lying as to this woman now who had the most money of all who had all the money there was who had had a husband and children who had taken lovers and been dissatisfied with them and who loved him dearly as a writer as a man as a companion and as a proud possession it was strange that when he did not love her at all and was lying that he should be able to give her more for her money than when he had really loved we must all be cut out for what we do he thought however you make your living is where your talent lies he had sold vitality in one form or another all his life and when your affections are not too involved you give much better value for the money he had found that out but he would never write that now either no he would not write that although it was well worth writing now she came in sight walking across the open toward the camp she was wearing jodphurs and carrying her rifle the two boys had a tommie slung and they were coming along behind her she was still a good looking woman he thought and she had a pleasant body she had a great talent and appreciation for the bed she was not pretty but he liked her face she read enormously liked to ride and shoot and certainly she drank too much her husband had died when she was still a comparatively young woman and for a while she had devoted herself to her two just grown children who did not need her and were embarrassed at having her about to her stable of horses to books and to bottles she liked to read in the evening before dinner and she drank scotch and soda while she read by dinner she was fairly drunk and after a bottle of wine at dinner she was usually drunk enough to sleep that was before the lovers after she had the lovers she did not drink so much because she did not have to be drunk to sleep but the lovers bored her she had been married to a man who had never bored her and these people bored her very much then one of her two children was killed in a plane crash and after that was over she did not want the lovers and drink being no anæsthetic she had to make another life suddenly she had been acutely frightened of being alone but she wanted some one that she respected with her it had begun very simply she liked what he wrote and she had always envied the life he led she thought he did exactly what he wanted to the steps by which she had acquired him and the way in which she had finally fallen in love with him were all part of a regular progression in which she had built herself a new life and he had traded away what remained of his old life he had traded it for security for comfort too there was no denying that and for what else he did not know she would have bought him anything he wanted he knew that she was a damned nice woman too he would as soon be in bed with her as any one rather with her because she was richer because she was very pleasant and appreciative and because she never made scenes and now this life that she had built again was coming to a term because he had not used iodine two weeks ago when a thorn had scratched his knee as they moved forward trying to photograph a herd of waterbuck standing their heads up peering while their nostrils searched the air their ears spread wide to hear the first noise that would send them rushing into the bush they had bolted too before he got the picture here she came now he turned his head on the cot to look toward her hello he said i shot a tommy ram she told him he ll make you good broth and i ll have them mash some potatoes with the klim how do you feel much better isn t that lovely you know i thought perhaps you would you were sleeping when i left i had a good sleep did you walk far no just around behind the hill i made quite a good shot on the tommy you shoot marvellously you know i love it i ve loved africa really if you re all right it s the most fun that i ve ever had you don t know the fun it s been to shoot with you i ve loved the country i love it too darling you don t know how marvellous it is to see you feeling better i couldn t stand it when you felt that way you won t talk to me like that again will you promise me no he said i don t remember what i said you don t have to destroy me do you i m only a middle aged woman who loves you and wants to do what you want to do i ve been destroyed two or three times already you wouldn t want to destroy me again would you i d like to destroy you a few times in bed he said yes that s the good destruction that s the way we re made to be destroyed the plane will be here tomorrow how do you know i m sure it s bound to come the boys have the wood all ready and the grass to make the smudge i went down and looked at it again today there s plenty of room to land and we have the smudges ready at both ends what makes you think it will come tomorrow i m sure it will it s overdue now then in town they will fix up your leg and then we will have some good destruction not that dreadful talking kind should we have a drink the sun is down do you think you should i m having one we ll have one together molo letti dui whiskey soda she called you d better put on your mosquito boots he told her i ll wait till i bathe while it grew dark they drank and just before it was dark and there was no longer enough light to shoot a hyena crossed the open on his way around the hill that bastard crosses there every night the man said every night for two weeks he s the one makes the noise at night i don t mind it they re a filthy animal though drinking together with no pain now except the discomfort of lying in the one position the boys lighting a fire its shadow jumping on the tents he could feel the return of acquiescence in this life of pleasant surrender she was very good to him he had been cruel and unjust in the afternoon she was a fine woman marvellous really and just then it occurred to him that he was going to die it came with a rush not as a rush of water nor of wind but of a sudden evil smelling emptiness and the odd thing was that the hyena slipped lightly along the edge of it what is it harry she asked him nothing he said you had better move over to the other side to windward did molo change the dressing yes i m just using the boric now how do you feel a little wobbly i m going in to bathe she said i ll be right out i ll eat with you and then we ll put the cot in so he said to himself we did well to stop the quarrelling he had never quarrelled much with this woman while with the women that he loved he had quarrelled so much they had finally always with the corrosion of the quarrelling killed what they had together he had loved too much demanded too much and he wore it all out he thought about alone in constantinople that time having quarrelled in paris before he had gone out he had whored the whole time and then when that was over and he had failed to kill his loneliness but only made it worse he had written her the first one the one who left him a letter telling her how he had never been able to kill it how when he thought he saw her outside the regence one time it made him go all faint and sick inside and that he would follow a woman who looked like her in some way along the boulevard afraid to see it was not she afraid to lose the feeling it gave him how every one he had slept with had only made him miss her more how what she had done could never matter since he knew he could not cure himself of loving her he wrote this letter at the club cold sober and mailed it to new york asking her to write him at the of ice in paris that seemed safe and that night missing her so much it made him feel hollow sick inside he wandered up past maxim s picked a girl up and took her out to supper he had gone to a place to dance with her afterward she danced badly and left her for a hot armenian slut that swung her belly against him so it almost scalded he took her away from a british gunner subaltern after a row the gunner asked him outside and they fought in the street on the cobbles in the dark he d hit him twice hard on the side of the jaw and when he didn t go down he knew he was in for a fight the gunner hit him in the body then beside his eye he swung with his left again and landed and the gunner fell on him and grabbed his coat and tore the sleeve of and he clubbed him twice behind the ear and then smashed him with his right as he pushed him away when the gunner went down his head hit first and he ran with the girl because they heard the m p s coming they got into a taxi and drove out to rimmily hissa along the bosphorus and around and back in the cool night and went to bed and she felt as over ripe as she looked but smooth rose petal syrupy smooth bellied big breasted and needed no pillow under her buttocks and he left her before she was awake looking blousy enough in the first daylight and turned up at the pera palace with a black eye carrying his coat because one sleeve was missing that same night he left for anatolia and he remembered later on that trip riding all day through fields of the poppies that they raised for opium and how strange it made you feel finally and all the distances seemed wrong to where they had made the attack with the newly arrived constantine of icers that did not know a god damned thing and the artillery had fired into the troops and the british observer had cried like a child that was the day he d first seen dead men wearing white ballet skirts and upturned shoes with pompons on them the turks had come steadily and lumpily and he had seen the skirted men running and the of icers shooting into them and running then themselves and he and the british observer had run too until his lungs ached and his mouth was full of the taste of pennies and they stopped behind some rocks and there were the turks coming as lumpily as ever later he had seen the things that he could never think of and later still he had seen much worse so when he got back to paris that time he could not talk about it or stand to have it mentioned and there in the café as he passed was that american poet with a pile of saucers in front of him and a stupid look on his potato face talking about the dada movement with a roumanian who said his name was tristan tzara who always wore a monocle and had a headache and back at the apartment with his wife that now he loved again the quarrel all over the madness all over glad to be home the of ice sent his mail up to the flat so then the letter in answer to the one he d written came in on a platter one morning and when he saw the handwriting he went cold all over and tried to slip the letter underneath another but his wife said who is that letter from dear and that was the end of the beginning of that he remembered the good times with them all and the quarrels they always picked the finest places to have the quarrels and why had they always quarrelled when he was feeling best he had never written any of that because at first he never wanted to hurt any one and then it seemed as though there was enough to write without it but he had always thought that he would write it finally there was so much to write he had seen the world change not just the events although he had seen many of them and had watched the people but he had seen the subtler change and he could remember how the people were at dif erent times he had been in it and he had watched it and it was his duty to write of it but now he never would how do you feel she said she had come out from the tent now after her bath all right could you eat now he saw molo behind her with the folding table and the other boy with the dishes i want to write he said you ought to take some broth to keep your strength up i m going to die tonight he said i don t need my strength up don t be melodramatic harry please she said why don t you use your nose i m rotted half way up my thigh now what the hell should i fool with broth for molo bring whiskey soda please take the broth she said gently all right the broth was too hot he had to hold it in the cup until it cooled enough to take it and then he just got it down without gagging you re a fine woman he said don t pay any attention to me she looked at him with her well known well loved face from spur and town country only a little the worse for drink only a little the worse for bed but town country never showed those good breasts and those useful thighs and those lightly small of back caressing hands and as he looked and saw her well known pleasant smile he felt death come again this time there was no rush it was a puff as of a wind that makes a candle flicker and the flame go tall they can bring my net out later and hang it from the tree and build the fire up i m not going in the tent tonight it s not worth moving it s a clear night there won t be any rain so this was how you died in whispers that you did not hear well there would be no more quarrelling he could promise that the one experience that he had never had he was not going to spoil now he probably would you spoiled everything but perhaps he wouldn t you can t take dictation can you i never learned she told him that s all right there wasn t time of course although it seemed as though it telescoped so that you might put it all into one paragraph if you could get it right there was a log house chinked white with mortar on a hill above the lake there was a bell on a pole by the door to call the people in to meals behind the house were fields and behind the fields was the timber a line of lombardy poplars ran from the house to the dock other poplars ran along the point a road went up to the hills along the edge of the timber and along that road he picked blackberries then that log house was burned down and all the guns that had been on deer foot racks above the open fire place were burned and afterwards their barrels with the lead melted in the magazines and the stocks burned away lay out on the heap of ashes that were used to make lye for the big iron soap kettles and you asked grandfather if you could have them to play with and he said no you see they were his guns still and he never bought any others nor did he hunt any more the house was rebuilt in the same place out of lumber now and painted white and from its porch you saw the poplars and the lake beyond but there were never any more guns the barrels of the guns that had hung on the deer feet on the wall of the log house lay out there on the heap of ashes and no one ever touched them in the black forest after the war we rented a trout stream and there were two ways to walk to it one was down the valley from triberg and around the valley road in the shade of the trees that bordered the white road and then up a side road that went up through the hills past many small farms with the big schwarzwald houses until that road crossed the stream that was where our fishing began the other way was to climb steeply up to the edge of the woods and then go across the top of the hills through the pine woods and then out to the edge of a meadow and down across this meadow to the bridge there were birches along the stream and it was not big but narrow clear and fast with pools where it had cut under the roots of the birches at the hotel in triberg the proprietor had a fine season it was very pleasant and we were all great friends the next year came the inflation and the money he had made the year before was not enough to buy supplies to open the hotel and he hanged himself you could dictate that but you could not dictate the place contrescarpe where the flower sellers dyed their flowers in the street and the dye ran over the paving where the autobus started and the old men and the women always drunk on wine and bad marc and the children with their noses running in the cold the smell of dirty sweat and poverty and drunkenness at the café des amateurs and the whores at the bal musette they lived above the concierge who entertained the trooper of the garde republicaine in her loge his horse hair plumed helmet on a chair the locataire across the hall whose husband was a bicycle racer and her joy that morning at the crémerie when she had opened l auto and seen where he placed third in paris tours his first big race she had blushed and laughed and then gone upstairs crying with the yellow sporting paper in her hand the husband of the woman who ran the bal musette drove a taxi and when he harry had to take an early plane the husband knocked upon the door to wake him and they each drank a glass of white wine at the zinc of the bar before they started he knew his neighbors in that quarter then because they all were poor around that place there were two kinds the drunkards and the sportifs the drunkards killed their poverty that way the sportifs took it out in exercise they were the descendants of the communards and it was no struggle for them to know their politics they knew who had shot their fathers their relatives their brothers and their friends when the versailles troops came in and took the town after the commune and executed any one they could catch with calloused hands or who wore a cap or carried any other sign he was a working man and in that poverty and in that quarter across the street from a boucherie chevaline and a wine cooperative he had written the start of all he was to do there never was another part of paris that he loved like that the sprawling trees the old white plastered houses painted brown below the long green of the autobus in that round square the purple flower dye upon the paving the sudden drop down the hill of the rue cardinal lemoine to the river and the other way the narrow crowded world of the rue mouf etard the street that ran up toward the pantheon and the other that he always took with the bicycle the only asphalted street in all that quarter smooth under the tires with the high narrow houses and the cheap tall hotel where paul verlaine had died there were only two rooms in the apartments where they lived and he had a room on the top floor of that hotel that cost him sixty francs a month where he did his writing and from it he could see the roofs and chimney pots and all the hills of paris from the apartment you could only see the wood and coal man s place he sold wine too bad wine the golden horse s head outside the boucherie chevaline where the carcasses hung yellow gold and red in the open window and the green painted co operative where they bought their wine good wine and cheap the rest was plaster walls and the windows of the neighbors the neighbors who at night when some one lay drunk in the street moaning and groaning in that typical french ivresse that you were propaganded to believe did not exist would open their windows and then the murmur of talk where is the policeman when you don t want him the bugger is always there he s sleeping with some concierge get the agent till some one threw a bucket of water from a window and the moaning stopped what s that water ah that s intelligent and the windows shutting marie his femme de ménage protesting against the eight hour day saying if a husband works until six he gets only a little drunk on the way home and does not waste too much if he works only until five he is drunk every night and one has no money it is the wife of the working man who suf ers from this shortening of hours wouldn t you like some more broth the woman asked him now no thank you very much it is awfully good try just a little i would like a whiskey soda it s not good for you no it s bad for me cole porter wrote the words and the music this knowledge that you re going mad for me you know i like you to drink oh yes only it s bad for me when she goes he thought i ll have all i want not all i want but all there is ayee he was tired too tired he was going to sleep a little while he lay still and death was not there it must have gone around another street it went in pairs on bicycles and moved absolutely silently on the pavements no he had never written about paris not the paris that he cared about but what about the rest that he had never written what about the ranch and the silvered gray of the sage brush the quick clear water in the irrigation ditches and the heavy green of the alfalfa the trail went up into the hills and the cattle in the summer were shy as deer the bawling and the steady noise and slow moving mass raising a dust as you brought them down in the fall and behind the mountains the clear sharpness of the peak in the evening light and riding down along the trail in the moonlight bright across the valley now he remembered coming down through the timber in the dark holding the horse s tail when you could not see and all the stories that he meant to write about the half wit chore boy who was left at the ranch that time and told not to let any one get any hay and that old bastard from the forks who had beaten the boy when he had worked for him stopping to get some feed the boy refusing and the old man saying he would beat him again the boy got the rifle from the kitchen and shot him when he tried to come into the barn and when they came back to the ranch he d been dead a week frozen in the corral and the dogs had eaten part of him but what was left you packed on a sled wrapped in a blanket and roped on and you got the boy to help you haul it and the two of you took it out over the road on skis and sixty miles down to town to turn the boy over he having no idea that he would be arrested thinking he had done his duty and that you were his friend and he would be rewarded he d helped to haul the old man in so everybody could know how bad the old man had been and how he d tried to steal some feed that didn t belong to him and when the sherif put the handcuf s on the boy he couldn t believe it then he d started to cry that was one story he had saved to write he knew at least twenty good stories from out there and he had never written one why you tell them why he said why what dear why nothing she didn t drink so much now since she had him but if he lived he would never write about her he knew that now nor about any of them the rich were dull and they drank too much or they played too much backgammon they were dull and they were repetitious he remembered poor julian and his romantic awe of them and how he had started a story once that began the very rich are different from you and me and how some one had said to julian yes they have more money but that was not humorous to julian he thought they were a special glamourous race and when he found they weren t it wrecked him just as much as any other thing that wrecked him he had been contemptuous of those who wrecked you did not have to like it because you understood it he could beat anything he thought because no thing could hurt him if he did not care all right now he would not care for death one thing he had always dreaded was the pain he could stand pain as well as any man until it went on too long and wore him out but here he had something that had hurt frightfully and just when he had felt it breaking him the pain had stopped he remembered long ago when williamson the bombing of icer had been hit by a stick bomb some one in a german patrol had thrown as he was coming in through the wire that night and screaming had begged every one to kill him he was a fat man very brave and a good of icer although addicted to fantastic shows but that night he was caught in the wire with a flare lighting him up and his bowels spilled out into the wire so when they brought him in alive they had to cut him loose shoot me harry for christ sake shoot me they had had an argument one time about our lord never sending you anything you could not bear and some one s theory had been that meant that at a certain time the pain passed you out automatically but he had always remembered williamson that night nothing passed out williamson until he gave him all his morphine tablets that he had always saved to use himself and then they did not work right away still this now that he had was very easy and if it was no worse as it went on there was nothing to worry about except that he would rather be in better company he thought a little about the company that he would like to have no he thought when everything you do you do too long and do too late you can t expect to find the people still there the people all are gone the party s over and you are with your hostess now i m getting as bored with dying as with everything else he thought it s a bore he said out loud what is my dear anything you do too bloody long he looked at her face between him and the fire she was leaning back in the chair and the firelight shone on her pleasantly lined face and he could see that she was sleepy he heard the hyena make a noise just outside the range of the fire i ve been writing he said but i got tired do you think you will be able to sleep pretty sure why don t you turn in i like to sit here with you do you feel anything strange he asked her no just a little sleepy i do he said he had just felt death come by again you know the only thing i ve never lost is curiosity he said to her you ve never lost anything you re the most complete man i ve ever known christ he said how little a woman knows what is that your intuition because just then death had come and rested its head on the foot of the cot and he could smell its breath never believe any of that about a scythe and a skull he told her it can be two bicycle policemen as easily or be a bird or it can have a wide snout like a hyena it had moved up on him now but it had no shape any more it simply occupied space tell it to go away it did not go away but moved a little closer you ve got a hell of a breath he told it you stinking bastard it moved up closer to him still and now he could not speak to it and when it saw he could not speak it came a little closer and now he tried to send it away without speaking but it moved in on him so its weight was all upon his chest and while it crouched there and he could not move or speak he heard the woman say bwana is asleep now take the cot up very gently and carry it into the tent he could not speak to tell her to make it go away and it crouched now heavier so he could not breathe and then while they lifted the cot suddenly it was all right and the weight went from his chest it was morning and had been morning for some time and he heard the plane it showed very tiny and then made a wide circle and the boys ran out and lit the fires using kerosene and piled on grass so there were two big smudges at each end of the level place and the morning breeze blew them toward the camp and the plane circled twice more low this time and then glided down and levelled off and landed smoothly and coming walking toward him was old compton in slacks a tweed jacket and a brown felt hat what s the matter old cock compton said bad leg he told him will you have some breakfast thanks i ll just have some tea it s the puss moth you know i won t be able to take the memsahib there s only room for one your lorry is on the way helen had taken compton aside and was speaking to him compton came back more cheery than ever we ll get you right in he said i ll be back for the mem now i m afraid i ll have to stop at arusha to refuel we d better get going what about the tea i don t really care about it you know the boys had picked up the cot and carried it around the green tents and down along the rock and out onto the plain and along past the smudges that were burning brightly now the grass all consumed and the wind fanning the fire to the little plane it was difficult getting him in but once in he lay back in the leather seat and the leg was stuck straight out to one side of the seat where compton sat compton started the motor and got in he waved to helen and to the boys and as the clatter moved into the old familiar roar they swung around with compie watching for warthog holes and roared bumping along the stretch between the fires and with the last bump rose and he saw them all standing below waving and the camp beside the hill flattening now and the plain spreading clumps of trees and the bush flattening while the game trails ran now smoothly to the dry waterholes and there was a new water that he had never known of the zebra small rounded backs now and the wildebeeste big headed dots seeming to climb as they moved in long fingers across the plain now scattering as the shadow came toward them they were tiny now and the movement had no gallop and the plain as far as you could see gray yellow now and ahead old compie s tweed back and the brown felt hat then they were over the first hills and the wildebeeste were trailing up them and then they were over mountains with sudden depths of green rising forest and the solid bamboo slopes and then the heavy forest again sculptured into peaks and hollows until they crossed and hills sloped down and then another plain hot now and purple brown bumpy with heat and compie looking back to see how he was riding then there were other mountains dark ahead and then instead of going on to arusha they turned left he evidently figured that they had the gas and looking down he saw a pink sifting cloud moving over the ground and in the air like the first snow in a blizzard that comes from nowhere and he knew the locusts were coming up from the south then they began to climb and they were going to the east it seemed and then it darkened and they were in a storm the rain so thick it seemed like flying through a waterfall and then they were out and compie turned his head and grinned and pointed and there ahead all he could see as wide as all the world great high and unbelievably white in the sun was the square top of kilimanjaro and then he knew that there was where he was going just then the hyena stopped whimpering in the night and started to make a strange human almost crying sound the woman heard it and stirred uneasily she did not wake in her dream she was at the house on long island and it was the night before her daughter s début somehow her father was there and he had been very rude then the noise the hyena made was so loud she woke and for a moment she did not know where she was and she was very afraid then she took the flashlight and shone it on the other cot that they had carried in after harry had gone to sleep she could see his bulk under the mosquito bar but somehow he had gotten his leg out and it hung down alongside the cot the dressings had all come down and she could not look at it molo she called molo molo then she said harry harry then her voice rising harry please oh harry there was no answer and she could not hear him breathing outside the tent the hyena made the same strange noise that had awakened her but she did not hear him for the beating of her heart old man at the bridge an old man with steel rimmed spectacles and very dusty clothes sat by the side of the road there was a pontoon bridge across the river and carts trucks and men women and children were crossing it the mule drawn carts staggered up the steep bank from the bridge with soldiers helping push against the spokes of the wheels the trucks ground up and away heading out of it all and the peasants plodded along in the ankle deep dust but the old man sat there without moving he was too tired to go any farther it was my business to cross the bridge explore the bridgehead beyond and find out to what point the enemy had advanced i did this and returned over the bridge there were not so many carts now and very few people on foot but the old man was still there where do you come from i asked him from san carlos he said and smiled that was his native town and so it gave him pleasure to mention it and he smiled i was taking care of animals he explained oh i said not quite understanding yes he said i stayed you see taking care of animals i was the last one to leave the town of san carlos he did not look like a shepherd nor a herdsman and i looked at his black dusty clothes and his gray dusty face and his steel rimmed spectacles and said what animals were they various animals he said and shook his head i had to leave them i was watching the bridge and the african looking country of the ebro delta and wondering how long now it would be before we would see the enemy and listening all the while for the first noises that would signal that ever mysterious event called contact and the old man still sat there what animals were they i asked there were three animals altogether he explained there were two goats and a cat and then there were four pairs of pigeons and you had to leave them i asked yes because of the artillery the captain told me to go because of the artillery and you have no family i asked watching the far end of the bridge where a few last carts were hurrying down the slope of the bank no he said only the animals i stated the cat of course will be all right a cat can look out for itself but i cannot think what will become of the others what politics have you i asked i am without politics he said i am seventy six years old i have come twelve kilometers now and i think now i can go no further this is not a good place to stop i said if you can make it there are trucks up the road where it forks for tortosa i will wait a while he said and then i will go where do the trucks go towards barcelona i told him i know no one in that direction he said but thank you very much thank you again very much he looked at me very blankly and tiredly then said having to share his worry with some one the cat will be all right i am sure there is no need to be unquiet about the cat but the others now what do you think about the others why they ll probably come through it all right you think so why not i said watching the far bank where now there were no carts but what will they do under the artillery when i was told to leave because of the artillery did you leave the dove cage unlocked i asked yes then they ll fly yes certainly they ll fly but the others it s better not to think about the others he said if you are rested i would go i urged get up and try to walk now thank you he said and got to his feet swayed from side to side and then sat down backwards in the dust i was taking care of animals he said dully but no longer to me i was only taking care of animals there was nothing to do about him it was easter sunday and the fascists were advancing toward the ebro it was a gray overcast day with a low ceiling so their planes were not up that and the fact that cats know how to look after themselves was all the good luck that old man would ever have up in michigan jim gilmore came to hortons bay from canada he bought the blacksmith shop from old man horton jim was short and dark with big mustaches and big hands he was a good horseshoer and did not look much like a blacksmith even with his leather apron on he lived upstairs above the blacksmith shop and took his meals at d j smith s liz coates worked for smith s mrs smith who was a very large clean woman said liz coates was the neatest girl she d ever seen liz had good legs and always wore clean gingham aprons and jim noticed that her hair was always neat behind he liked her face because it was so jolly but he never thought about her liz liked jim very much she liked it the way he walked over from the shop and often went to the kitchen door to watch for him to start down the road she liked it about his mustache she liked it about how white his teeth were when he smiled she liked it very much that he didn t look like a blacksmith she liked it how much d j smith and mrs smith liked jim one day she found that she liked it the way the hair was black on his arms and how white they were above the tanned line when he washed up in the washbasin outside the house liking that made her feel funny hortons bay the town was only five houses on the main road between boyne city and charlevoix there was the general store and post office with a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front smith s house stroud s house dillworth s house horton s house and van hoosen s house the houses were in a big grove of elm trees and the road was very sandy there was farming country and timber each way up the road up the road a ways was the methodist church and down the road the other direction was the township school the blacksmith shop was painted red and faced the school a steep sandy road ran down the hill to the bay through the timber from smith s back door you could look out across the woods that ran down to the lake and across the bay it was very beautiful in the spring and summer the bay blue and bright and usually whitecaps on the lake out beyond the point from the breeze blowing from charlevoix and lake michigan from smith s back door liz could see ore barges way out in the lake going toward boyne city when she looked at them they didn t seem to be moving at all but if she went in and dried some more dishes and then came out again they would be out of sight beyond the point all the time now liz was thinking about jim gilmore he didn t seem to notice her much he talked about the shop to d j smith and about the republican party and about james g blaine in the evenings he read the toledo blade and the grand rapids paper by the lamp in the front room or went out spearing fish in the bay with a jacklight with d j smith in the fall he and smith and charley wyman took a wagon and tent grub axes their rifles and two dogs and went on a trip to the pine plains beyond vanderbilt deer hunting liz and mrs smith were cooking for four days for them before they started liz wanted to make something special for jim to take but she didn t finally because she was afraid to ask mrs smith for the eggs and flour and afraid if she bought them mrs smith would catch her cooking it would have been all right with mrs smith but liz was afraid all the time jim was gone on the deer hunting trip liz thought about him it was awful while he was gone she couldn t sleep well from thinking about him but she discovered it was fun to think about him too if she let herself go it was better the night before they were to come back she didn t sleep at all that is she didn t think she slept because it was all mixed up in a dream about not sleeping and really not sleeping when she saw the wagon coming down the road she felt weak and sick sort of inside she couldn t wait till she saw jim and it seemed as though everything would be all right when he came the wagon stopped outside under the big elm and mrs smith and liz went out all the men had beards and there were three deer in the back of the wagon their thin legs sticking stiff over the edge of the wagon box mrs smith kissed d j and he hugged her jim said hello liz and grinned liz hadn t known just what would happen when jim got back but she was sure it would be something nothing had happened the men were just home that was all jim pulled the burlap sacks off the deer and liz looked at them one was a big buck it was stiff and hard to lift out of the wagon did you shoot it jim liz asked yeah ain t it a beauty jim got it onto his back to carry to the smokehouse that night charley wyman stayed to supper at smith s it was too late to get back to charlevoix the men washed up and waited in the front room for supper ain t there something left in that crock jimmy d j smith asked and jim went out to the wagon in the barn and fetched in the jug of whiskey the men had taken hunting with them it was a four gallon jug and there was quite a little slopped back and forth in the bottom jim took a long pull on his way back to the house it was hard to lift such a big jug up to drink out of it some of the whiskey ran down on his shirt front the two men smiled when jim came in with the jug d j smith sent for glasses and liz brought them d j poured out three big shots well here s looking at you d j said charley wyman that damn big buck jimmy said d j here s all the ones we missed d j said jim and downed his liquor tastes good to a man nothing like it this time of year for what ails you how about another boys here s how d j down the creek boys here s to next year jim began to feel great he loved the taste and the feel of whiskey he was glad to be back to a comfortable bed and warm food and the shop he had another drink the men came in to supper feeling hilarious but acting very respectable liz sat at the table after she put on the food and ate with the family it was a good dinner the men ate seriously after supper they went into the front room again and liz cleaned off with mrs smith then mrs smith went upstairs and pretty soon smith came out and went upstairs too jim and charley were still in the front room liz was sitting in the kitchen next to the stove pretending to read a book and thinking about jim she didn t want to go to bed yet because she knew jim would be coming out and she wanted to see him as he went out so she could take the way he looked up to bed with her she was thinking about him hard and then jim came out his eyes were shining and his hair was a little rumpled liz looked down at her book jim came over back of her chair and stood there and she could feel him breathing and then he put his arms around her her breasts felt plump and firm and the nipples were erect under his hands liz was terribly frightened no one had ever touched her but she thought he s come to me finally he s really come she held herself stiff because she was so frightened and did not know anything else to do and then jim held her tight against the chair and kissed her it was such a sharp aching hurting feeling that she thought she couldn t stand it she felt jim right through the back of the chair and she couldn t stand it and then something clicked inside of her and the feeling was warmer and softer jim held her tight hard against the chair and she wanted it now and jim whispered come on for a walk liz took her coat off the peg on the kitchen wall and they went out the door jim had his arm around her and every little way they stopped and pressed against each other and jim kissed her there was no moon and they walked ankle deep in the sandy road through the trees down to the dock and the warehouse on the bay the water was lapping in the piles and the point was dark across the bay it was cold but liz was hot all over from being with jim they sat down in the shelter of the warehouse and jim pulled liz close to him she was frightened one of jim s hands went inside her dress and stroked over her breast and the other hand was in her lap she was very frightened and didn t know how he was going to go about things but she snuggled close to him then the hand that felt so big in her lap went away and was on her leg and started to move up it don t jim liz said jim slid the hand further up you mustn t jim you mustn t neither jim nor jim s big hand paid any attention to her the boards were hard jim had her dress up and was trying to do something to her she was frightened but she wanted it she had to have it but it frightened her you mustn t do it jim you mustn t i got to i m going to you know we got to no we haven t jim we ain t got to oh it isn t right oh it s so big and it hurts so you can t oh jim jim oh the hemlock planks of the dock were hard and splintery and cold and jim was heavy on her and he had hurt her liz pushed him she was so uncomfortable and cramped jim was asleep he wouldn t move she worked out from under him and sat up and straightened her skirt and coat and tried to do something with her hair jim was sleeping with his mouth a little open liz leaned over and kissed him on the cheek he was still asleep she lifted his head a little and shook it he rolled his head over and swallowed liz started to cry she walked over to the edge of the dock and looked down to the water there was a mist coming up from the bay she was cold and miserable and everything felt gone she walked back to where jim was lying and shook him once more to make sure she was crying jim she said jim please jim jim stirred and curled a little tighter liz took off her coat and leaned over and covered him with it she tucked it around him neatly and carefully then she walked across the dock and up the steep sandy road to go to bed a cold mist was coming up through the woods from the bay on the quai at smyrna the strange thing was he said how they screamed every night at midnight i do not know why they screamed at that time we were in the harbor and they were all on the pier and at midnight they started screaming we used to turn the searchlight on them to quiet them that always did the trick we d run the searchlight up and down over them two or three times and they stopped it one time i was senior officer on the pier and a turkish officer came up to me in a frightful rage because one of our sailors had been most insulting to him so i told him the fellow would be sent on ship and be most severely punished i asked him to point him out so he pointed out a gunner s mate most inoffensive chap said he d been most frightfully and repeatedly insulting talking to me through an interpreter i couldn t imagine how the gunner s mate knew enough turkish to be insulting i called him over and said and just in case you should have spoken to any turkish officers i haven t spoken to any of them sir i m quite sure of it i said but you d best go on board ship and not come ashore again for the rest of the day then i told the turk the man was being sent on board ship and would be most severely dealt with oh most rigorously he felt topping about it great friends we were the worst he said were the women with dead babies you couldn t get the women to give up their dead babies they d have babies dead for six days wouldn t give them up nothing you could do about it had to take them away finally then there was an old lady most extraordinary case i told it to a doctor and he said i was lying we were clearing them off the pier had to clear off the dead ones and this old woman was lying on a sort of litter they said will you have a look at her sir so i had a look at her and just then she died and went absolutely stiff her legs drew up and she drew up from the waist and went quite rigid exactly as though she had been dead over night she was quite dead and absolutely rigid i told a medical chap about it and he told me it was impossible they were all out there on the pier and it wasn t at all like an earthquake or that sort of thing because they never knew about the turk they never knew what the old turk would do you remember when they ordered us not to come in to take off any more i had the wind up when we came in that morning he had any amount of batteries and could have blown us clean out of the water we were going to come in run close along the pier let go the front and rear anchors and then shell the turkish quarter of the town they would have blown us out of water but we would have blown the town simply to hell they just fired a few blank charges at us as we came in kemal came down and sacked the turkish commander for exceeding his authority or some such thing he got a bit above himself it would have been the hell of a mess you remember the harbor there were plenty of nice things floating around in it that was the only time in my life i got so i dreamed about things you didn t mind the women who were having babies as you did those with the dead ones they had them all right surprising how few of them died you just covered them over with something and let them go to it they d always pick out the darkest place in the hold to have them none of them minded anything once they got off the pier the greeks were nice chaps too when they evacuated they had all their baggage animals they couldn t take off with them so they just broke their forelegs and dumped them into the shallow water all those mules with their forelegs broken pushed over into the shallow water it was all a pleasant business my word yes a most pleasant business chapter i everybody was drunk the whole battery was drunk going along the road in the dark we were going to the champagne the lieutenant kept riding his horse out into the fields and saying to him i m drunk i tell you mon vieux oh i am so soused we went along the road all night in the dark and the adjutant kept riding up alongside my kitchen and saying you must put it out it is dangerous it will be observed we were fifty kilometers from the front but the adjutant worried about the fire in my kitchen it was funny going along that road that was when i was a kitchen corporal indian camp at the lake shore there was an other rowboat drawn up the two indians stood waiting nick and his father got in the stern of the boat and the indians shoved it off and one of them got in to row uncle george sat in the stern of the camp rowboat the young indian shoved the camp boat off and got in to row uncle george the two boats started off in the dark nick heard the oarlocks of the other boat quite a way ahead of them in the mist the indians rowed with quick choppy strokes nick lay back with his father s arm around him it was cold on the water the indian who was rowing them was working very hard but the other boat moved further ahead in the mist all the time where are we going dad nick asked over to the indian camp there is an indian lady very sick oh said nick across the bay they found the other boat beached uncle george was smoking a cigar in the dark the young indian pulled the boat way up on the beach uncle george gave both the indians cigars they walked up from the beach through a meadow that was soaking wet with dew following the young indian who carried a lantern then they went into the woods and followed a trail that led to the logging road that ran back into the hills it was much lighter on the logging road as the timber was cut away on both sides the young indian stopped and blew out his lantern and they all walked on along the road they came around a bend and a dog came out barking ahead were the lights of the shanties where the indian bark peelers lived more dogs rushed out at them the two indians sent them back to the shanties in the shanty nearest the road there was a light in the window an old woman stood in the doorway holding a lamp inside on a wooden bunk lay a young indian woman she had been trying to have her baby for two days all the old women in the camp had been helping her the men had moved off up the road to sit in the dark and smoke out of range of the noise she made she screamed just as nick and the two indians followed his father and uncle george into the shanty she lay in the lower bunk very big under a quilt her head was turned to one side in the upper bunk was her husband he had cut his foot very badly with an ax three days before he was smoking a pipe the room smelled very bad nick s father ordered some water to be put on the stove and while it was heating he spoke to nick this lady is going to have a baby nick he said i know said nick you don t know said his father listen to me what she is going through is called being in labor the baby wants to be born and she wants it to be born all her muscles are trying to get the baby born that is what is happening when she screams i see nick said just then the woman cried out oh daddy can t you give her something to make her stop screaming asked nick no i haven t any anæsthetic his father said but her screams are not important i don t hear them because they are not important the husband in the upper bunk rolled over against the wall the woman in the kitchen motioned to the doctor that the water was hot nick s father went into the kitchen and poured about half of the water out of the big kettle into a basin into the water left in the kettle he put several things he unwrapped from a handkerchief those must boil he said and began to scrub his hands in the basin of hot water with a cake of soap he had brought from the camp nick watched his father s hands scrubbing each other with the soap while his father washed his hands very carefully and thoroughly he talked you see nick babies are supposed to be born head first but sometimes they re not when they re not they make a lot of trouble for everybody maybe i ll have to operate on this lady we ll know in a little while when he was satisfied with his hands he went in and went to work pull back that quilt will you george he said i d rather not touch it later when he started to operate uncle george and three indian men held the woman still she bit uncle george on the arm and uncle george said damn squaw bitch and the young indian who had rowed uncle george over laughed at him nick held the basin for his father it all took a long time his father picked the baby up and slapped it to make it breathe and handed it to the old woman see it s a boy nick he said how do you like being an interne nick said all right he was looking away so as not to see what his father was doing there that gets it said his father and put something into the basin nick didn t look at it now his father said there s some stitches to put in you can watch this or not nick just as you like i m going to sew up the incision i made nick did not watch his curiosity had been gone for a long time his father finished and stood up uncle george and the three indian men stood up nick put the basin out in the kitchen uncle george looked at his arm the young indian smiled reminiscently i ll put some peroxide on that george the doctor said he bent over the indian woman she was quiet now and her eyes were closed she looked very pale she did not know what had become of the baby or anything i ll be back in the morning the doctor said standing up the nurse should be here from st ignace by noon and she ll bring everything we need he was feeling exalted and talkative as football players are in the dressing room after a game that s one for the medical journal george he said doing a cæsarian with a jack knife and sewing it up with nine foot tapered gut leaders uncle george was standing against the wall looking at his arm oh you re a great man all right he said ought to have a look at the proud father they re usually the worst sufferers in these little affairs the doctor said i must say he took it all pretty quietly he pulled back the blanket from the indian s head his hand came away wet he mounted on the edge of the lower bunk with the lamp in one hand and looked in the indian lay with his face toward the wall his throat had been cut from ear to ear the blood had flowed down into a pool where his body sagged the bunk his head rested on his left arm the open razor lay edge up in the blankets take nick out of the shanty george the doctor said there was no need of that nick standing in the door of the kitchen had a good view of the upper bunk when his father the lamp in one hand tipped the indian s head back it was just beginning to be daylight when they walked along the logging road back toward the lake i m terribly sorry i brought you along nickie said his father all his post operative exhilaration gone it was an awful mess to put you through do ladies always have such a hard time having babies nick asked no that was very very exceptional why did he kill himself daddy i don t know nick he couldn t stand things i guess do many men kill themselves daddy not very many nick do many women hardly ever don t they ever oh yes they do sometimes daddy yes where did uncle george go he ll turn up all right is dying hard daddy no i think it s pretty easy nick it all depends they were seated in the boat nick in the stern his father rowing the sun was coming up over the hills a bass jumped making a circle in the water nick trailed his hand in the water it felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning in the early morning on the lake sitting in the stern of the boat with his father rowing he felt quite sure that he would never die chapter ii minarets stuck up in the rain out of adrianople across the mud flats the carts were jammed for thirty miles along the karagatch road water buf alo and cattle were hauling carts through the mud no end and no beginning just carts loaded with everything they owned the old men and women soaked through walked along keeping the cattle moving the maritza was running yellow almost up to the bridge carts were jammed solid on the bridge with camels bobbing along through them greek cavalry herded along the procession women and kids were in the carts crouched with mattresses mirrors sewing machines bundles there was a woman having a kid with a young girl holding a blanket over her and crying scared sick looking at it it rained all through the evacuation the doctor and the doctor s wife dick boulton came from the indian camp to cut up logs for nick s father he brought his son eddy and another indian named billy tabeshaw with him they came in through the back gate out of the woods eddy carrying the long cross cut saw it flopped over his shoulder and made a musical sound as he walked billy tabeshaw carried two big canthooks dick had three axes under his arm he turned and shut the gate the others went on ahead of him down to the lake shore where the logs were buried in the sand the logs had been lost from the big log booms that were towed down the lake to the mill by the steamer magic they had drifted up onto the beach and if nothing were done about them sooner or later the crew of the magic would come along the shore in a rowboat spot the logs drive an iron spike with a ring on it into the end of each one and then tow them out into the lake to make a new boom but the lumbermen might never come for them because a few logs were not worth the price of a crew to gather them if no one came for them they would be left to waterlog and rot on the beach nick s father always assumed that this was what would happen and hired the indians to come down from the camp and cut the logs up with the cross cut saw and split them with a wedge to make cord wood and chunks for the open fireplace dick boulton walked around past the cottage down to the lake there were four big beech logs lying almost buried in the sand eddy hung the saw up by one of its handles in the crotch of a tree dick put the three axes down on the little dock dick was a halfbreed and many of the farmers around the lake believed he was really a white man he was very lazy but a great worker once he was started he took a plug of tobacco out of his pocket bit off a chew and spoke in ojibway to eddy and billy tabeshaw they sunk the ends of their cant hooks into one of the logs and swung against it to loosen it in the sand they swung their weight against the shafts of the cant hooks the log moved in the sand dick boulton turned to nick s father well doc he said that s a nice lot of timber you ve stolen don t talk that way dick the doctor said it s driftwood eddy and billy tabeshaw had rocked the log out of the wet sand and rolled it toward the water put it right in dick boulton shouted what are you doing that for asked the doctor wash it off clean off the sand on account of the saw i want to see who it belongs to dick said the log was just awash in the lake eddy and billy tabeshaw leaned on their cant hooks sweating in the sun dick kneeled down in the sand and looked at the mark of the scaler s hammer in the wood at the end of the log it belongs to white and mcnally he said standing up and brushing off his trousers knees the doctor was very uncomfortable you d better not saw it up then dick he said shortly don t get huffy doc said dick don t get huffy i don t care who you steal from it s none of my business if you think the logs are stolen leave them alone and take your tools back to the camp the doctor said his face was red don t go off at half cock doc dick said he spat tobacco juice on the log it slid off thinning in the water you know they re stolen as well as i do it don t make any difference to me all right if you think the logs are stolen take your stuff and get out now doc take your stuff and get out listen doc if you call me doc once again i ll knock your eye teeth down your throat oh no you won t doc dick boulton looked at the doctor dick was a big man he knew how big a man he was he liked to get into fights he was happy eddy and billy tabeshaw leaned on their cant hooks and looked at the doctor the doctor chewed the beard on his lower lip and looked at dick boulton then he turned away and walked up the hill to the cottage they could see from his back how angry he was they all watched him walk up the hill and go inside the cottage dick said something in ojibway eddy laughed but billy tabeshaw looked very serious he did not understand english but he had sweat all the time the row was going on he was fat with only a few hairs of mustache like a chinaman he picked up the two cant hooks dick picked up the axes and eddy took the saw down from the tree they started off and walked up past the cottage and out the back gate into the woods dick left the gate open billy tabeshaw went back and fastened it they were gone through the woods in the cottage the doctor sitting on the bed in his room saw a pile of medical journals on the floor by the bureau they were still in their wrappers unopened it irritated him aren t you going back to work dear asked the doctor s wife from the room where she was lying with the blinds drawn no was anything the matter i had a row with dick boulton oh said his wife i hope you didn t lose your temper henry no said the doctor remember that he who ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city said his wife she was a christian scientist her bible her copy of science and health and her quarterly were on a table beside her bed in the darkened room her husband did not answer he was sitting on his bed now cleaning a shotgun he pushed the magazine full of the heavy yellow shells and pumped them out again they were scattered on the bed henry his wife called then paused a moment henry yes the doctor said you didn t say anything to boulton to anger him did you no said the doctor what was the trouble about dear nothing much tell me henry please don t try and keep anything from me what was the trouble about well dick owes me a lot of money for pulling his squaw through pneumonia and i guess he wanted a row so he wouldn t have to take it out in work his wife was silent the doctor wiped his gun carefully with a rag he pushed the shells back in against the spring of the magazine he sat with the gun on his knees he was very fond of it then he heard his wife s voice from the darkened room dear i don t think i really don t think that any one would really do a thing like that no the doctor said no i can t really believe that any one would do a thing of that sort intentionally the doctor stood up and put the shotgun in the corner behind the dresser are you going out dear his wife said i think i ll go for a walk the doctor said if you see nick dear will you tell him his mother wants to see him his wife said the doctor went out on the porch the screen door slammed behind him he heard his wife catch her breath when the door slammed sorry he said outside her window with the blinds drawn it s all right dear she said he walked in the heat out the gate and along the path into the hemlock woods it was cool in the woods even on such a hot day he found nick sitting with his back against a tree reading your mother wants you to come and see her the doctor said i want to go with you nick said his father looked down at him all right come on then his father said give me the book i ll put it in my pocket i know where there s black squirrels daddy nick said all right said his father let s go there chapter iii we were in a garden at mons young buckley came in with his patrol from across the river the first german i saw climbed up over the garden wall we waited till he got one leg over and then potted him he had so much equipment on and looked awfully surprised and fell down into the garden then three more came over farther down the wall we shot them they all came just like that the end of something in the old days hortons bay was a lumbering town no one who lived in it was out of sound of the big saws in the mill by the lake then one year there were no more logs to make lumber the lumber schooners came into the bay and were loaded with the cut of the mill that stood stacked in the yard all the piles of lumber were carried away the big mill building had all its machinery that was removable taken out and hoisted on board one of the schooners by the men who had worked in the mill the schooner moved out of the bay toward the open lake carrying the two great saws the travelling carriage that hurled the logs against the revolving circular saws and all the rollers wheels belts and iron piled on a hull deep load of lumber its open hold covered with canvas and lashed tight the sails of the schooner filled and it moved out into the open lake carrying with it everything that had made the mill a mill and hortons bay a town the one story bunk houses the eating house the company store the mill offices and the big mill itself stood deserted in the acres of sawdust that covered the swampy meadow by the shore of the bay ten years later there was nothing of the mill left except the broken white limestone of its foundations showing through the swampy second growth as nick and marjorie rowed along the shore they were trolling along the edge of the channel bank where the bottom dropped off suddenly from sandy shallows to twelve feet of dark water they were trolling on their way to the point to set night lines for rainbow trout there s our old ruin nick marjorie said nick rowing looked at the white stone in the green trees there it is he said can you remember when it was a mill marjorie asked i can just remember nick said it seems more like a castle marjorie said nick said nothing they rowed on out of sight of the mill following the shore line then nick cut across the bay they aren t striking he said no marione said she was intent on the rod all the time they trolled even when she talked she loved to fish she loved to fish with nick close beside the boat a big trout broke the surface of the water nick pulled hard on one oar so the boat would turn and the bait spinning far behind would pass where the trout was feeding as the trout s back came up out of the water the minnows jumped wildly they sprinkled the surface like a handful of shot thrown into the water another trout broke water feeding on the other side of the boat they re feeding marjorie said but they won t strike nick said he rowed the boat around to troll past both the feeding fish then headed it for the point marjorie did not reel in until the boat touched the shore they pulled the boat up the beach and nick lifted out a pail of live perch the perch swam in the water in the pail nick caught three of them with his hands and cut their heads off and skinned them while marjorie chased with her hands in the bucket finally caught a perch cut its head off and skinned it nick looked at her fish you don t want to take the ventral fin out he said it ll be all right for bait but it s better with the ventral fin in he hooked each of the skinned perch through the tail there were two hooks attached to a leader on each rod then marjorie rowed the boat out over the channel bank holding the line in her teeth and looking toward nick who stood on the shore holding the rod and letting the line run out from the reel that s about right he called should i let it drop marjorie called back holding the line in her hand sure let it go marjorie dropped the line overboard and watched the baits go down through the water she came in with the boat and ran the second line out the same way each time nick set a heavy slab of driftwood across the butt of the rod to hold it solid and propped it up at an angle with a small slab he reeled in the slack line so the line ran taut out to where the bait rested on the sandy floor of the channel and set the click on the reel when a trout feeding on the bottom took the bait it would run with it taking line out of the reel in a rush and making the reel sing with the click on marjorie rowed up the point a little way so she would not disturb the line she pulled hard on the oars and the boat went way up the beach little waves came in with it marjorie stepped out of the boat and nick pulled the boat high up the beach what s the matter nick marjorie asked i don t know nick said getting wood for a fire they made a fire with driftwood marjorie went to the boat and brought a blanket the evening breeze blew the smoke toward the point so marjorie spread the blanket out between the fire and the lake marjorie sat on the blanket with her back to the fire and waited for nick he came over and sat down beside her on the blanket in back of them was the close second growth timber of the point and in front was the bay with the mouth of hortons creek it was not quite dark the fire light went as far as the water they could both see the two steel rods at an angle over the dark water the fire glinted on the reels marjorie unpacked the basket of supper i don t feel like eating said nick come on and eat nick all right they ate without talking and watched the two rods and the fire light in the water there s going to be a moon tonight said nick he looked across the bay to the hills that were beginning to sharpen against the sky beyond the hills he knew the moon was coming up i know it marjorie said happily you know everything nick said oh nick please cut it out please please don t be that way i can t help it nick said you do you know everything that s the trouble you know you do marjorie did not say anything i ve taught you everything you know you do what don t you know anyway oh shut up marjorie said there comes the moon they sat on the blanket without touching each other and watched the moon rise you don t have to talk silly marjorie said what s really the matter i don t know of course you know no i don t go on and say it nick looked on at the moon coming up over the hills it isn t fun any more he was afraid to look at marjorie then he looked at her she sat there with her back toward him he looked at her back it isn t fun any more not any of it she didn t say anything he went on i feel as though everything was gone to hell inside of me i don t know marge i don t know what to say he looked on at her back isn t love any fun marjorie said no nick said marjorie stood up nick sat there his head in his hands i m going to take the boat marjorie called to him you can walk back around the point all right nick said i ll push the boat off for you you don t need to she said she was afloat in the boat on the water with the moonlight on it nick went back and lay down with his face in the blanket by the fire he could hear marjorie rowing on the water he lay there for a long time he lay there while he heard bill come into the clearing walking around through the woods he felt bill coming up to the fire bill didn t touch him either did she go all right bill said yes nick said lying his face on the blanket have a scene no there wasn t any scene how do you feel oh go away bill go away for a while bill selected a sandwich from the lunch basket and walked over to have a look at the rods chapter iv it was a frightfully hot day we d jammed an absolutely perfect barricade across the bridge it was simply priceless a big old wrought iron grating from the front of a house too heavy to lift and you could shoot through it and they would have to climb over it it was absolutely topping they tried taget over it and we potted them from forty yards they rushed it and of icers came out alone and worked on it it was an absolutely perfect obstacle their of icers were very fine we were frightfully put out when we heard the flank had gone and we had to fall back the three day blow the rain stopped as nick turned into the road that went up through the orchard the fruit had been picked and the fall wind blew through the bare trees nick stopped and picked up a wagner apple from beside the road shiny in the brown grass from the rain he put the apple in the pocket of his mackinaw coat the road came out of the orchard on to the top of the hill there was the cottage the porch bare smoke coming from the chimney in back was the garage the chicken coop and the second growth timber like a hedge against the woods behind the big trees swayed far over in the wind as he watched it was the first of the autumn storms as nick crossed the open field above the orchard the door of the cottage opened and bill came out he stood on the porch looking out well wemedge he said hey bill nick said coming up the steps they stood together looking out across the country down over the orchard beyond the road across the lower fields and the woods of the point to the lake the wind was blowing straight down the lake they could see the surf along ten mile point she s blowing nick said she ll blow like that for three days bill said is your dad in nick said no he s out with the gun come on in nick went inside the cottage there was a big fire in the fireplace the wind made it roar bill shut the door have a drink he said he went out to the kitchen and came back with two glasses and a pitcher of water nick reached the whisky bottle from the shelf above the fireplace all right he said good said bill they sat in front of the fire and drank the irish whisky and water it s got a swell smoky taste nick said and looked at the fire through the glass that s the peat bill said you can t get peat into liquor nick said that doesn t make any difference bill said you ever seen any peat nick asked no said bill neither have i nick said his shoes stretched out on the hearth began to steam in front of the fire better take your shoes off bill said i haven t got any socks on take them off and dry them and i ll get you some bill said he went upstairs into the loft and nick heard him walking about overhead upstairs was open under the roof and was where bill and his father and he nick sometimes slept in back was a dressing room they moved the cots back out of the rain and covered them with rubber blankets bill came down with a pair of heavy wool socks it s getting too late to go around without socks he said i hate to start them again nick said he pulled the socks on and slumped back in the chair putting his feet up on the screen in front of the fire you ll dent in the screen bill said nick swung his feet over to the side of the fireplace got anything to read he asked only the paper what did the cards do dropped a double header to the giants that ought to cinch it for them it s a gift bill said as long as mcgraw can buy every good ball player in the league there s nothing to it he can t buy them all nick said he buys all the ones he wants bill said or he makes them discontented so they have to trade them to him like heinie zim nick agreed that bonehead will do him a lot of good bill stood up he can hit nick offered the heat from the fire was baking his legs he s a sweet fielder too bill said but he loses ball games maybe that s what mcgraw wants him for nick suggested maybe bill agreed there s always more to it than we know about nick said of course but we ve got pretty good dope for being so far away like how much better you can pick them if you don t see the horses that s it bill reached down the whisky bottle his big hand went all the way around it he poured the whisky into the glass nick held out how much water just the same he sat down on the floor beside nick s chair it s good when the fall storms come isn t it nick said it s swell it s the best time of year nick said wouldn t it be hell to be in town bill said i d like to see the world series nick said well they re always in new york or philadelphia now bill said that doesn t do us any good i wonder if the cards will ever win a pennant not in our lifetime bill said gee they d go crazy nick said do you remember when they got going that once before they had the train wreck boy nick said remembering bill reached over to the table under the window for the book that lay there face down where he had put it when he went to the door he held his glass in one hand and the book in the other leaning back against nick s chair what are you reading richard feverel i couldn t get into it it s all right bill said it ain t a bad book wemedge what else have you got i haven t read nick asked did you read the forest lovers yup that s the one where they go to bed every night with the naked sword between them that s a good book wemedge it s a swell book what i couldn t ever understand was what good the sword would do it would have to stay edge up all the time because if it went over flat you could roll right over it and it wouldn t make any trouble it s a symbol

it while bill poured bill poured the glass half full of whisky put in your own water he said there s just one more shot got any more nick asked there s plenty more but dad only likes me to drink what s open sure said nick he says opening bottles is what makes drunkards bill explained that s right said nick he was impressed he had never thought of that before he had always thought it was solitary drinking that made drunkards how is your dad he asked respectfully he s all right bill said he gets a little wild sometimes he s a swell guy nick said he poured water into his glass out of the pitcher it mixed slowly with the whisky there was more whisky than water you bet your life he is bill said my old man s all right nick said you re damn right he is said bill he claims he s never taken a drink in his life nick said as though announcing a scientific fact well he s a doctor my old man s a painter that s different he s missed a lot nick said sadly you can t tell bill said everything s got its compensations he says he s missed a lot himself nick confessed well dad s had a tough time bill said it all evens up nick said they sat looking into the fire and thinking of this profound truth i ll get a chunk from the back porch nick said he had noticed while looking into the fire that the fire was dying down also he wished to show he could hold his liquor and be practical even if his father had never touched a drop bill was not going to get him drunk before he himself was drunk bring one of the big beech chunks bill said he was also being consciously practical nick came in with the log through the kitchen and in passing knocked a pan off the kitchen table he laid the log down and picked up the pan it had contained dried apricots soaking in water he carefully picked up all the apricots off the floor some of them had gone under the stove and put them back in the pan he dipped some more water onto them from the pail by the table he felt quite proud of himself he had been thoroughly practical he came in carrying the log and bill got up from the chair and helped him put it on the fire that s a swell log nick said i d been saving it for the bad weather bill said a log like that will bum all night there ll be coals left to start the fire in the morning nick said that s right bill agreed they were conducting the conversation on a high plane let s have another drink nick said i think there s another bottle open in the locker bill said he kneeled down in the corner in front of the locker and brought out a square faced bottle it s scotch he said i ll get some more water nick said he went out into the kitchen again he filled the pitcher with the dipper dipping cold spring water from the pail on his way back to the living room he passed a mirror in the dining room and looked in it his face looked strange he smiled at the face in the mirror and it grinned back at him he winked at it and went on it was not his face but it didn t make any difference bill had poured out the drinks that s an awfully big shot nick said not for us wemedge bill said what ll we drink to nick asked holding up the glass let s drink to fishing bill said all right nick said gentlemen i give you fishing all fishing bill said everywhere fishing nick said that s what we drink to it s better than baseball bill said there isn t any comparison said nick how did we ever get

liquor bill poured in the water they looked at each other they felt very fine gentlemen bill said i give you chesterton and walpole exactly gentlemen nick said they drank bill filled up the glasses they sat down in the big chairs in front of the fire you were very wise wemedge bill said what do you mean asked nick to bust off that marge business bill said i guess so said nick it was the only

happy you can t mix oil and water and you can t mix that sort of thing any more than if i d marry ida that works for strattons she d probably like it too nick said nothing the liquor had all died out of him and left him alone bill wasn t there he wasn t sitting in front of the fire or going fishing tomorrow with bill and his dad or anything he wasn t drunk it was all gone all he knew was that he had once had marjorie and that he had lost her she was gone and he had sent her away that was all that mattered he might never see her again probably he never would it was all gone finished let s have

happy now there was not anything that was irrevocable he might go into town saturday night today was thursday there s always a chance he said you ll have to watch yourself bill said i ll watch myself he said he felt happy nothing was finished nothing was ever lost he would go into town on saturday he felt lighter as he had felt before bill started to talk about it there was always a way out let s take the guns and go down to the point and look for your dad nick said all right bill took down the two shotguns from the rack on the wall he opened a box of shells nick put on his mackinaw coat and his shoes his shoes were stiff from the drying he was still quite drunk but his head was clear how do you feel nick asked swell i ve just got a good edge on bill was buttoning up his sweater there s no use getting drunk no we ought to get outdoors they stepped out the door the wind was blowing a gale the birds will lie right down in the grass with this nick said they struck down toward the orchard i saw a woodcock this morning bill said maybe we ll jump him nick said you can t shoot in this wind bill said outside now the marge business was no longer so tragic it was not even very important the wind blew everything like that away it s coming right off the big lake nick said against the wind they heard the thud of a shotgun that s dad bill said he s down in the swamp let s cut down that way nick said let s cut across the lower meadow and see if we jump anything bill said all right nick said none of it was important now the wind blew it out of his head still he could always go into town saturday night it was a good thing to have in reserve chapter v they shot the six cabinet ministers at half past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital there were pools of water in the courtyard there were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard it rained hard all the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut one of the ministers was sick with typhoid two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain they tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water the other five stood very quietly against the wall finally the of icer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up when they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees the battler nick stood up he was all right he looked up the track at the lights of the caboose going out of sight around the curve there was water on both sides of the track then tamarack swamp he felt of his knee the pants were torn and the skin was barked his hands were scraped and there were sand and cinders driven up under his nails he went over to the edge of the track down the little slope to the water and washed his hands he washed them carefully in the cold water getting the dirt out from the nails he squatted down and bathed his knee that lousy crut of a brakeman he would get him some day he would know him again that was a fine way to act come here kid he said i got something for you he had fallen for it what a lousy kid thing to have done they would never suck him in that way again come here kid i got something for you then wham and he lit on his hands and knees beside the track nick rubbed his eye there was a big bump coming up he would have a black eye all right it ached already that son of a crutting brakeman he touched the bump over his eye with his fingers oh well it was only a black eye that was all he had gotten out of it cheap at the price he wished he could see it could not see it looking into the water though it was dark and he was a long way off from anywhere he wiped his hands on his trousers and stood up then climbed the embankment to the rails he started up the track it was well ballasted and made easy walking sand and gravel packed between the ties solid walking the smooth roadbed like a causeway went on ahead through the swamp nick walked along he must get to somewhere nick had swung on to the freight train when it slowed down for the yards outside of walton junction the train with nick on it had passed through kalkaska as it started to get dark now he must be nearly to mancelona three or four miles of swamp he stepped along the track walking so he kept on the ballast between the ties the swamp ghostly in the rising mist his eye ached and he was hungry he kept on hiking putting the miles of track back of him the swamp was all the same on both sides of the track ahead there was a bridge nick crossed it his boots ringing hollow on the iron down below the water showed black between the slits of ties nick kicked a loose spike and it dropped into the water beyond the bridge were hills it was high and dark on both sides of the track up the track nick saw a fire he came up the track toward the fire carefully it was off to one side of the track below the railway embankment he had only seen the light from it the track came out through a cut and where the fire was burning the country opened out and fell away into woods nick dropped carefully down the embankment and cut into the woods to come up to the fire through the trees it was a beechwood forest and the fallen beechnut burrs were under his shoes as he walked between the trees the fire was bright now just at the edge of the trees there was a man sitting by it nick waited behind the tree and watched the man looked to be alone he was sitting there with his head in his hands looking at the fire nick stepped out and walked into the firelight the man sat there looking into the fire when nick stopped quite close to him he did not move hello nick said the man looked up where did you get the shiner he said a brakeman busted me off the through freight yes i saw the bastard the man said he went through here bout an hour and a half ago he was walking along the top of the cars slapping his arms and singing the bastard it must have made him feel good to bust you the man said seriously i ll bust him get him with a rock sometime when he s going through the man advised i ll get him you re a tough one aren t you no nick answered all you kids are tough you got to be tough nick said that s what i said the man looked at nick and smiled in the firelight nick saw that his face was misshapen his nose was sunken his eyes were slits he had queer shaped lips nick did not perceive all this at once he only saw the man s face was queerly formed and mutilated it was like putty in color dead looking in the firelight don t you like my pan the man asked nick was embarrassed sure he said look here the man took off his cap he had only one ear it was thickened and tight against the side of his head where the other ear should have been there was a stump ever see one like that no said nick it made him a little sick i could take it the man said don t you think i could take it kid you bet they all bust their hands on me the little man said they couldn t hurt me he looked at nick sit down he said want

no neither have i ad said it ain t any good if you haven t got a watch nick dropped his wrist listen ad francis said take ahold again you count and i ll count up to sixty feeling the slow hard throb under his fingers nick started to count he heard the little man counting slowly one two three four five and on aloud sixty ad finished that s a minute what did you make it forty nick said that s right ad said happily she never speeds up a man dropped down the railroad embankment and came across the clearing to the fire hello bugs ad said hello bugs answered it was a negro s voice nick knew from the way he walked that he was a negro he stood with his back to them bending over the fire he straightened up this is my pal bugs ad said he s crazy too glad to meet you bugs said where you say you re from chicago nick said that s a fine town the negro said i didn t catch your name adams nick adams he says he s never been crazy bugs ad said he s got a lot coming to him the negro said he was unwrapping a package by the fire when are we going to eat bugs the prizefighter asked right away are you hungry nick hungry as hell hear that bugs i hear most of what goes on that ain t what i asked you yes i heard what the gentleman said into a skillet he was laying slices of ham as the skillet grew hot the grease sputtered and bugs crouching on long nigger legs over the fire turned the ham and broke eggs into the skillet tipping it from side to side to baste the eggs with the hot fat will you cut some bread out of that bag mister adams bugs turned from the fire sure nick reached in the bag and brought out a loaf of bread he cut six slices ad watched him and leaned forward let me take your knife nick he said no you don t the negro said hang onto your knife mister adams the prizefighter sat back will you bring me the bread mister adams bugs asked nick brought it over do you like to dip your bread in the ham fat the negro asked you bet perhaps we d better wait until later it s better at the finish of the meal here the negro picked up a slice of ham and laid it on one of the pieces of bread then slid an egg on top of it just close that sandwich will you please and give it to mister francis ad took the sandwich and started eating watch out how that egg runs the negro warned this is for you mister adams the remainder for myself nick bit into the sandwich the negro was sitting opposite him beside ad the hot fried ham and eggs tasted wonderful mister adams is right hungry the negro said the little man whom nick knew by name as a former champion fighter was silent he had said nothing since the negro had spoken about the knife may i offer you a slice of bread dipped right in the hot ham fat bugs said thanks a lot the little white man looked at nick will you have some mister adolph francis bugs offered from the skillet ad did not answer he was looking at nick mister francis came the nigger s soft voice ad did not answer he was looking at nick i spoke to you mister francis the nigger said softly ad kept on looking at nick he had his cap down over his eyes nick felt nervous how the hell do you get that way came out from under the cap sharply at nick who the hell do you think you are you re a snotty bastard you come in here where nobody asks you and eat a man s food and when he asks to borrow a knife you get snotty he glared at nick his face was white and his eyes almost out of sight under the cap you re a hot sketch who the hell asked you to butt in here nobody you re damn right nobody did nobody asked you to stay either you come in here and act snotty about my face and smoke my cigars and drink my liquor and then talk snotty where the hell do you think you get off nick said nothing ad stood up i ll tell you you yellow livered chicago bastard you re going

moved his head try and hit me i don t want to hit you you won t get out of it that way you re going to take a beating see come on and lead at me cut it out nick said all right then you bastard the little man looked down at nick s feet as he looked down the negro who had followed behind him as he moved away from the fire set himself and tapped him across the base of the skull he fell forward and bugs dropped the cloth wrapped blackjack on the grass the little man lay there his face in the grass the negro picked him up his head hanging and carried him to the fire his face looked bad the eyes open bugs laid him down gently will you bring me the water in the bucket mister adams he said i m afraid i hit him just a little hard the negro splashed water with his hand on the man s face and pulled his ears gently the eyes closed bugs stood up he s all right he said there s nothing to worry about i m sorry mister adams it s all right nick was looking down at the little man he saw the blackjack on the grass and picked it up it had a flexible handle and was limber in his hand it was made of worn black leather with a handkerchief wrapped around the heavy end that s a whalebone handle the negro smiled they don t make them any more i didn t know how well you could take care of yourself and anyway i didn t want you to hurt him or mark him up no more than he is the negro smiled again you hurt him yourself i know how to do it he won t remember nothing of it i have to do it to change him when he gets that way nick was still looking down at the little man lying his eyes closed in the firelight bugs put some wood on the fire don t you worry about him none mister adams i seen him like this plenty of times before what made him crazy nick asked oh a lot of things the negro answered from the fire would you like a cup of this coffee mister adams he handed nick the cup and smoothed the coat he had placed under the unconscious man s head he took too many beatings for one thing the negro sipped the coffee but that just made him sort of simple then his sister was his manager and they was always being written up in the papers all about brothers and sisters and how she loved her brother and how he loved his sister and then they got married in new york and that made a lot of unpleasantness i remember about it sure of course they wasn t brother and sister no more than a rabbit but there was a lot of people didn t like it either way and they commenced to have disagreements and one day she just went off and never come back he drank the coffee and wiped his lips with the pink palm of his hand he just went crazy will you have some more coffee mister adams thanks i seen her a couple of times the negro went on she was an awful good looking woman looked enough like him to be twins he wouldn t be bad looking without his face all busted he stopped the story seemed to be over i met him in jail the negro said he was busting people all the time after she went away and they put him in jail i was in for cuttin a man he smiled and went on soft voiced right away i liked him and when i got out i looked him up he likes to think i m crazy and i don t mind i like to be with him and i like seeing the country and i don t have to commit no larceny to do it i like living like a gentleman what do you all do nick asked oh nothing just move around he s got money he must have made a lot of money sure he spent all his money though or they took it away from him she sends him money he poked up the fire she s a mighty fine woman he said she looks enough like him to be his own twin the negro looked over at the little man lying breathing heavily his blond hair was down over his forehead his mutilated face looked childish in repose i can wake him up any time now mister adams if you don t mind i wish you d sort of pull out i don t like to not be hospitable but it might disturb him back again to see you i hate to have to thump him and it s the only thing to do when he gets started i have to sort of keep him away from people you don t mind do you mister adams no don t thank me mister adams i d have warned you about him but he seemed to have taken such a liking to you and i thought things were going to be all right you ll hit a town about two miles up the track mancelona they call it good bye i wish we could ask you to stay the night but it s just out of the question would you like to take some of that ham and some bread with you no you better take a sandwich all this in a low smooth polite nigger voice good well good bye mister adams good bye and good luck nick walked away from the fire across the clearing to the railway tracks out of the range of the fire he listened the low soft voice of the negro was talking nick could not hear the words then he heard the little man say i got an awful headache bugs you ll feel better mister francis the negro s voice soothed just you drink a cup of this hot coffee nick climbed the embankment and started up the track he found he had a ham sandwich in his hand and put it in his pocket looking back from the mounting grade before the track curved into the hills he could see the firelight in the clearing chapter vi nick sat against the wall of the church where they had dragged him to be clear of machine gun fire in the street both legs stuck out awkwardly he had been hit in the spine his face was sweaty and dirty the sun shone on his face the day was very hot rinaldi big backed his equipment sprawling lay face downward against the wall nick looked straight ahead brilliantly the pink wall of the house opposite had fallen out from the roof and an iron bedstead hung twisted toward the street two austrian dead lay in the rubble in the shade of the house up the street were other dead things were getting forward in the town it was going well stretcher bearers would be along any time now nick turned his head carefully and looked at rinaldi senta rinaldi senta you and me we ve made a separate peace rinaldi lay still in the sun breathing with dif iculty not patriots nick turned his head carefully away smiling sweatily rinaldi was a disappointing audience a very short story one hot evening in padua they carried him up onto the roof and he could look out over the top of the town there were chimney swifts in the sky after a while it got dark and the searchlights came out the others went down and took the bottles with them he and luz could hear them below on the balcony luz sat on the bed she was cool and fresh in the hot night luz stayed on night duty for three months they were glad to let her when they operated on him she prepared him for the operating table and they had a joke about friend or enema he went under the anæsthetic holding tight on to himself so he would not blab about anything during the silly talky time after he got on crutches he used to take the temperatures so luz would not have to get up from the bed there were only a few patients and they all knew about it they all liked luz as he walked back along the halls he thought of luz in his bed before he went back to the front they went into the duomo and prayed it was dim and quiet and there were other people praying they wanted to get married but there was not enough time for the banns and neither of them had birth certificates they felt as though they were married but they wanted every one to know about it and to make it so they could not lose it luz wrote him many letters that he never got until after the armistice fifteen came in a bunch to the front and he sorted them by the dates and read them all straight through they were all about the hospital and how much she loved him and how it was impossible to get along without him and how terrible it was missing him at night after the armistice they agreed he should go home to get a job so they might be married luz would not come home until he had a good job and could come to new york to meet her it was understood he would not drink and he did not want to see his friends or any one in the states only to get a job and be married on the train from padua to milan they quarrelled about her not being willing to come home at once when they had to say good bye in the station at milan they kissed good bye but were not finished with the quarrel he felt sick about saying good bye like that he went to america on a boat from genoa luz went back to pordenone to open a hospital it was lonely and rainy there and there was a battalion of arditi quartered in the town living in the muddy rainy town in the winter the major of the battalion made love to luz and she had never known italians before and finally wrote to the states that theirs had been only a boy and girl affair she was sorry and she knew he would probably not be able to understand but might some day forgive her and be grateful to her and she expected absolutely unexpectedly to be married in the spring she loved him as always but she realized now it was only a boy and girl love she hoped he would have a great career and believed in him absolutely she knew it was for the best the major did not marry her in the spring or any other time luz never got an answer to the letter to chicago about it a short time after he contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl in a loop department store while riding in a taxicab through lincoln park chapter vii while the bombardment was knocking the trench to pieces at fossalta he lay very flat and sweated and prayed oh jesus christ get me out of here dear jesus please get me out christ please please please christ if you ll only keep me from getting killed i ll do anything you say i believe in you and i ll tell every one in the world that you are the only one that matters please please dear jesus the shelling moved further up the line we went to work on the trench and in the morning the sun came up and the day was hot and muggy and cheerful and quiet the next night back at mestre he did not tell the girl he went upstairs with at the villa rossa about jesus and he never told anybody soldier s home krebs went to the war from a methodist college in kansas there is a picture which shows him among his fraternity brothers all of them wearing exactly the same height and style collar he enlisted in the marines in 1917 and did not return to the united states until the second division returned from the rhine in the summer of 1919 there is a picture which shows him on the rhine with two german girls and another corporal krebs and the corporal look too big for their uniforms the german girls are not beautiful the rhine does not show in the picture by the time krebs returned to his home town in oklahoma the greeting of heroes was over he came back much too late the men from the town who had been drafted had all been welcomed elaborately on their return there had been a great deal of hysteria now the reaction had set in people seemed to think it was rather ridiculous for krebs to be getting back so late years after the war was over at first krebs who had been at belleau wood soissons the champagne st mihiel and in the argonne did not want to talk about the war at all later he felt the need to talk but no one wanted to hear about it his town had heard too many atrocity stories to be thrilled by actualities krebs found that to be listened to at all he had to lie and after he had done this twice he too had a reaction against the war and against talking about it a distaste for everything that had happened to him in the war set in because of the lies he had told all of the times that had been able to make him feel cool and clear inside himself when he thought of them the times so long back when he had done the one thing the only thing for a man to do easily and naturally when he might have done something else now lost their cool valuable quality and then were lost themselves his lies were quite unimportant lies and consisted in attributing to himself things other men had seen done or heard of and stating as facts certain apocryphal incidents familiar to all soldiers even his lies were not sensational at the pool room his acquaintances who had heard detailed accounts of german women found chained to machine guns in the argonne forest and who could not comprehend or were barred by their patriotism from interest in any german machine gunners who were not chained were not thrilled by his stories krebs acquired the nausea in regard to experience that is the result of untruth or exaggeration and when he occasionally met another man who had really been a soldier and they talked a few minutes in the dressing room at a dance he fell into the easy pose of the old soldier among other soldiers that he had been badly sickeningly frightened all the time in this way he lost everything during this time it was late summer he was sleeping late in bed getting up to walk down town to the library to get a book eating lunch at home reading on the front porch until he became bored and then walking down through the town to spend the hottest hours of the day in the cool dark of the pool room he loved to play pool in the evening he practised on his clarinet strolled down town read and went to bed he was still a hero to his two young sisters his mother would have given him breakfast in bed if he had wanted it she often came in when he was in bed and asked him to tell her about the war but her attention always wandered his father was non committal before krebs went away to the war he had never been allowed to drive the family motor car his father was in the real estate business and always wanted the car to be at his command when he required it to take clients out into the country to show them a piece of farm property the car always stood outside the first national bank building where his father had an office on the second floor now after the war it was still the same car nothing was changed in the town except that the young girls had grown up but they lived in such a complicated world of already defined alliances and shifting feuds that krebs did not feel the energy or the courage to break into it he liked to look at them though there were so many good looking young girls most of them had their hair cut short when he went away only little girls wore their hair like that or girls that were fast they all wore sweaters and shirt waists with round dutch collars it was a pattern he liked to look at them from the front porch as they walked on the other side of the street he liked to watch them walking under the shade of the trees he liked the round dutch collars above their sweaters he liked their silk stockings and flat shoes he liked their bobbed hair and the way they walked when he was in town their appeal to him was not very strong he did not like them when he saw them in the greek s ice cream parlor he did not want them themselves really they were too complicated there was something else vaguely he wanted a girl but he did not want to have to work to get her he would have liked to have a girl but he did not want to have to spend a long time getting her he did not want to get into the intrigue and the politics he did not want to have to do any courting he did not want to tell any more lies it wasn t worth it he did not want any consequences he did not want any consequences ever again he wanted to live along without consequences besides he did not really need a girl the army had taught him that it was all right to pose as though you had to have a girl nearly everybody did that but it wasn t true you did not need a girl that was the funny thing first a fellow boasted how girls mean nothing to him that he never thought of them that they could not touch him then a fellow boasted that he could not get along without girls that he had to have them all the time that he could not go to sleep without them that was all a lie it was all a lie both ways you did not need a girl unless you thought about them he learned that in the army then sooner or later you always got one when you were really ripe for a girl you always got one you did not have to think about it sooner or later it would come he had learned that in the army now he would have liked a girl if she had come to him and not wanted to talk but here at home it was all too complicated he knew he could never get through it all again it was not worth the trouble that was the thing about french girls and german girls there was not all this talking you couldn t talk much and you did not need to talk it was simple and you were friends he thought about france and then he began to think about germany on the whole he had liked germany better he did not want to leave germany he did not want to come home still he had come home he sat on the front porch he liked the girls that were walking along the other side of the street he liked the look of them much better than the french girls or the german girls but the world they were in was not the world he was in he would like to have one of them but it was not worth it they were such a nice pattern he liked the pattern it was exciting but he would not go through all the talking he did not want one badly enough he liked to look at them all though it was not worth it not now when things were getting good again he sat there on the porch reading a book on the war it was a history and he was reading about all the engagements he had been in it was the most interesting reading he had ever done he wished there were more maps he looked forward with a good feeling to reading all the really good histories when they would come out with good detail maps now he was really learning about the war he had been a good soldier that made a difference one morning after he had been home about a month his mother came into his bedroom and sat on the bed she smoothed her apron i had a talk with your father last night harold she said and he is willing for you to take the car out in the evenings yeah said krebs who was not fully awake take the car out yeah yes your father has felt for some time that you should be able to take the car out in the evenings whenever you wished but we only talked it over last night i ll bet you made him krebs said no it was your father s suggestion that we talk the matter over yeah i ll bet you made him krebs sat up in bed will you come down to breakfast harold his mother said as soon as i get my clothes on krebs said his mother went out of the room and he could hear her frying something downstairs while he washed shaved and dressed to go down into the dining room for breakfast while he was eating breakfast his sister brought in the mail well hare she said you old sleepy head what do you ever get up for krebs looked at her he liked her she was his best sister have you got the paper he asked she handed him the kansas city star and he shucked off its brown wrapper and opened it to the sporting page he folded the star open and propped it against the water pitcher with his cereal dish to steady it so he could read while he ate harold his mother stood in the kitchen doorway harold please don t muss up the paper your father can t read his star if it s been mussed i won t muss it krebs said his sister sat down at the table and watched him while he read we re playing indoor over at school this afternoon she said i m going to pitch good said krebs how s the old wing i can pitch better than lots of the boys i tell them all you taught me the other girls aren t much good yeah said krebs i tell them all you re my beau aren t you my beau hare you bet couldn t your brother really be your beau

will you love me always sure will you come over and watch me play indoor maybe aw hare you don t love me if you loved me you d want to come over and watch me play indoor krebs s mother came into the dining room from the kitchen she carried a plate with two fried eggs and some crisp bacon on it and a plate of buckwheat cakes you run along helen she said i want to talk to harold she put the eggs and bacon down in front of him and brought in a jug of maple syrup for the buckwheat cakes then she sat down across the table from krebs i wish you d put down the paper a minute harold she said krebs took down the paper and folded it have you decided what you are going to do yet harold his mother said taking off her glasses no said krebs don t you think it s about time his mother did not say this in a mean way she seemed worried i hadn t thought about it krebs said god has some work for every one to do his mother said there can be no idle hands in his kingdom i m not in his kingdom krebs said we are all of us in his kingdom krebs felt embarrassed and resentful as always i ve worried about you so much harold his mother went on i know the temptations you must have been exposed to i know how weak men are i know what your own dear grandfather my own father told us about the civil war and i have prayed for you i pray for you all day long harold krebs looked at the bacon fat hardening on his plate your father is worried too his mother went on he thinks you have lost your ambition that you haven t got a definite aim in life charley simmons who is just your age has a good job and is going to be married the boys are all settling down they re all determined to get somewhere you can see that boys like charley simmons are on their way to being really a credit to the community krebs said nothing don t look that way harold his mother said you know we love you and i want to tell you for your own good how matters stand your father does not want to hamper your freedom he thinks you should be allowed to drive the car if you want to take some of the nice girls out riding with you we are only too pleased we want you to enjoy yourself but you are going to have to settle down to work harold your father doesn t care what you start in at all work is honorable as he says but you ve got to make a start at something he asked me to speak to you this morning and then you can stop in and see him at his office is that all krebs said yes don t you love your mother dear boy no krebs said his mother looked at him across the table her eyes were shiny she started crying i don t love anybody krebs said it wasn t any good he couldn t tell her he couldn t make her see it it was silly to have said it he had only hurt her he went over and took hold of her arm she was crying with her head in her hands i didn t mean it he said i was just angry at something i didn t mean i didn t love you his mother went on crying krebs put his arm on her shoulder can t you believe me mother his mother shook her head please please mother please believe me all right his mother said chokily she looked up at him i believe you harold krebs kissed her hair she put her face up to him i m your mother she said i held you next to my heart when you were a tiny baby krebs felt sick and vaguely nauseated i know mummy he said i ll try and be a good boy for you would you kneel and pray with me harold his mother asked they knelt down beside the dining room table and krebs s mother prayed now you pray harold she said i can t krebs said try harold i can t do you want me to pray for you yes so his mother prayed for him and then they stood up and krebs kissed his mother and went out of the house he had tried so to keep his life from being complicated still none of it had touched him he had felt sorry for his mother and she had made him lie he would go to kansas city and get a job and she would feel all right about it there would be one more scene maybe before he got away he would not go down to his father s office he would miss that one he wanted his life to go smoothly it had just gotten going that way well that was all over now anyway he would go over to the schoolyard and watch helen play indoor

italy carrying a square of oilcloth from the headquarters of the party written in indelible pencil and saying here was a comrade who had suffered very much under the whites in budapest and requesting comrades to aid him in any way he used this instead of a ticket he was very shy and quite young and the train men passed him on from one crew to another he had no money and they fed him behind the counter in railway eating houses he was delighted with italy it was a beautiful country he said the people were all kind he had been in many towns walked much and seen many pictures giotto masaccio and piero della francesca he bought reproductions of and carried them wrapped in a copy of avanti mantegna he did not like he reported at bologna and i took him with me up into the romagna where it was necessary i go to see a man we had a good trip together it was early september and the country was pleasant he was a magyar a very nice boy and very shy horthy s men had done some bad things to him he talked about it a little in spite of hungary he believed altogether in the world revolution but how is the movement going in italy he asked very badly i said but it will go better he said you have everything here it is the one country that every one is sure of it will be the starting point of everything i did not say anything at bologna he said good bye to us to go on the train to milano and then to aosta to walk over the pass into switzerland i spoke to him about the mantegnas in milano no he said very shyly he did not like mantegna i wrote out for him where to eat in milano and the addresses of comrades he thanked me very much but his mind was already looking forward to walking over the pass he was very eager to walk over the pass while the weather held good he loved the mountains in the autumn the last i heard of him the swiss had him in jail near sion chapter ix the first matador got the horn through his sword hand and the crowd hooted him the second matador slipped and the bull caught him through the belly and he hung on to the horn with one hand and held the other tight against the place and the bull rammed him wham against the wall and the horn came out and he lay in the sand and then got up like crazy drunk and tried to slug the men carrying him away and yelled for his sword but he fainted the kid came out and had to kill five bulls because you can t have more than three matadors and the last bull he was so tired he couldn t get the sword in he couldn t hardly lift his arm he tried five times and the crowd was quiet because it was a good bull and it looked like him or the bull and then he finally made it he sat down in the sand and puked and they held a cape over him while the crowd hollered and threw things down into the bull ring mr and mrs elliot mr and mrs elliot tried very hard to have a baby they tried as often as mrs elliot could stand it they tried in boston after they were married and they tried coming over on the boat they did not try very often on the boat because mrs elliot was quite sick she was sick and when she was sick she was sick as southern women are sick that is women from the southern part of the united states like all southern women mrs elliot disintegrated very quickly under sea sickness travelling at night and getting up too early in the morning many of the people on the boat took her for elliot s mother other people who knew they were married believed she was going to have a baby in reality she was forty years old her years had been precipitated suddenly when she started travelling she had seemed much younger in fact she had seemed not to have any age at all when elliot had married her after several weeks of making love to her after knowing her for a long time in her tea shop before he had kissed her one evening hubert elliot was taking postgraduate work in law at harvard when he was married he was a poet with an income of nearly ten thousand dollars a year he wrote very long poems very rapidly he was twenty five years old and had never gone to bed with a woman until he married mrs elliot he wanted to keep himself pure so that he could bring to his wife the same purity of mind and body that he expected of her he called it to himself living straight he had been in love with various girls before he kissed mrs elliot and always told them sooner or later that he had led a clean life nearly all the girls lost interest in him he was shocked and really horrified at the way girls would become engaged to and marry men whom they must know had dragged themselves through the gutter he once tried to warn a girl he knew against a man of whom he had almost proof that he had been a rotter at college and a very unpleasant incident had resulted mrs elliot s name was cornelia she had taught him to call her calutina which was her family nickname in the south his mother cried when he brought cornelia home after their marriage but brightened very much when she learned they were going to live abroad cornelia had said you dear sweet boy and held him closer than ever when he had told her how he had kept himself clean for her cornelia was pure too kiss me again like that she said hubert explained to her that he had learned that way of kissing from hearing a fellow tell a story once he was delighted with his experiment and they developed it as far as possible sometimes when they had been kissing together a long time cornelia would ask him to tell her again that he had kept himself really straight for her the declaration always set her off again at first hubert had no idea of marrying cornelia he had never thought of her that way she had been such a good friend of his and then one day in the little back room of the shop they had been dancing to the gramophone while her girl friend was in the front of the shop and she had looked up into his eyes and he had kissed her he could never remember just when it was decided that they were to be married but they were married they spent the night of the day they were married in a boston hotel they were both disappointed but finally cornelia went to sleep hubert could not sleep and several times went out and walked up and down the corridor of the hotel in his new jaeger bathrobe that he had bought for his wedding trip as he walked he saw all the pairs of shoes small shoes and big shoes outside the doors of the hotel rooms this set his heart to pounding and he hurried back to his own room but cornelia was asleep he did not like to waken her and soon everything was quite all right and he slept peacefully the next day they called on his mother and the next day they sailed for europe it was possible to try to have a baby but cornelia could not attempt it very often although they wanted a baby more than anything else in the world they landed at cherbourg and came to paris they tried to have a baby in paris then they decided to go to dijon where there was summer school and where a number of people who crossed on the boat with them had gone they found there was nothing to do in dijon hubert however was writing a great number of poems and cornelia typed them for him they were all very long poems he was very severe about mistakes and would make her re do an entire page if there was one mistake she cried a good deal and they tried several times to have a baby before they left dijon they came to paris and most of their friends from the boat came back too they were tired of dijon and anyway would now be able to say that after leaving harvard or columbia or wabash they had studied at the university of dijon down in the côte d or many of them would have preferred to go to languedoc montpellier or perpignan if there are universities there but all those places are too far away dijon is only four and a half hours from paris and there is a diner on the train so they all sat around the café du dome avoiding the rotonde across the street because it is always so full of foreigners for a few days and then the elliots rented a château in touraine through an advertisement in the new york herald elliot had a number of friends by now all of whom admired his poetry and mrs elliot had prevailed upon him to send over to boston for her girl friend who had been in the tea shop mrs elliot became much brighter after her girl friend came and they had many good cries together the girl friend was several years older than cornelia and called her honey she too came from a very old southern family the three of them with several of elliot s friends who called him hubie went down to the château in touraine they found touraine to be a very flat hot country very much like kansas elliot had nearly enough poems for a book now he was going to bring it out in boston and had already sent his check to and made a contract with a publisher in a short time the friends began to drift back to paris touraine had not turned out the way it looked when it started soon all the friends had gone off with a rich young and unmarried poet to a seaside resort near trouville there they were all very happy elliot kept on at the château in touraine because he had taken it for all summer he and mrs elliot tried very hard to have a baby in the big hot bedroom on the big hard bed mrs elliot was learning the touch system on the typewriter but she found that while it increased the speed it made more mistakes the girl friend was now typing practically all of the manuscripts she was very neat and efficient and seemed to enjoy it elliot had taken to drinking white wine and lived apart in his own room he wrote a great deal of poetry during the night and in the morning looked very exhausted mrs elliot and the girl friend now slept together in the big mediæval bed they had many a good cry together in the evening they all sat at dinner together in the garden under a plane tree and the hot evening wind blew and elliot drank white wine and mrs elliot and the girl friend made conversation and they were all quite happy chapter x they whack whacked the white horse on the legs and he kneed himself up the picador twisted the stirrups straight and pulled and hauled up into the saddle the horse s entrails hung down in a blue bunch and swung backward and forward as he began to canter the monos whacking him on the back of his legs with the rods he cantered jerkily along the barrera he stopped stif and one of the monos held his bridle and walked him forward the picador kicked in his spurs leaned forward and shook his lance at the bull blood pumped regularly from between the horse s front legs he was nervously wobbly the bull could not make up his mind to charge cat in the rain there were only two americans stopping at the hotel they did not know any of the people they passed on the stairs on their way to and from their room their room was on the second floor facing the sea it also faced the public garden and the war monument there were big palms and green benches in the public garden in the good weather there was always an artist with his easel artists liked the way the palms grew and the bright colors of the hotels facing the gardens and the sea italians came from a long way off to look up at the war monument it was made of bronze and glistened in the rain it was raining the rain dripped from the palm trees water stood in pools on the gravel paths the sea broke in a long line in the rain and slipped back down the beach to come up and break again in a long line in the rain the motor cars were gone from the square by the war monument across the square in the doorway of the café a waiter stood looking out at the empty square the american wife stood at the window looking out outside right under their window a cat was crouched under one of the dripping green tables the cat was trying to make herself so compact that she would not be dripped on i m going down and get that kitty the american wife said i ll do it her husband offered from the bed no i ll get it the poor kitty out trying to keep dry under a table the husband went on reading lying propped up with the two pillows at the foot of the bed don t get wet he said the wife went downstairs and the hotel owner stood up and bowed to her as she passed the office his desk was at the far end of the office he was an old man and very tall il piove the wife said she liked the hotel keeper sì sì signera brutto tempo it s very bad weather he stood behind his desk in the far end of the dim room the wife liked him she liked the deadly serious way he received any complaints she liked his dignity she liked the way he wanted to serve her she liked the way he felt about being a hotel keeper she liked his old heavy face and big hands liking him she opened the door and looked out it was raining harder a man in a rubber cape was crossing the empty square to the café the cat would be around to the right perhaps she could go along under the eaves as she stood in the doorway an umbrella opened behind her it was the maid who looked after their room you must not get wet she smiled speaking italian of course the hotel keeper had sent her with the maid holding the umbrella over her she walked along the gravel path until she was under their window the table was there washed bright green in the rain but the cat was gone she was suddenly disappointed the maid looked up at her ha perduto qualche cosa signera there was a cat said the american girl a cat si il gatto a cat the maid laughed a cat in the rain yes she said under the table then oh i wanted it so much i wanted a kitty when she talked english the maid s face tightened come signora she said we must get back inside you will be wet i suppose so said the american girl they went back along the gravel path and passed in the door the maid stayed outside to close the umbrella as the american girl passed the office the padrone bowed from his desk something felt very small and tight inside the girl the padrone made her feel very small and at the same time really important she had a momentary feeling of being of supreme importance she went on up the stairs she opened the door of the room george was on the bed reading did you get the cat he asked putting the book down it was gone wonder where it went to he said resting his eyes from reading she sat down on the bed i wanted it so much she said i don t know why i wanted it so much i wanted that poor kitty it isn t any fun to be a poor kitty out in the rain george was reading again she went over and sat in front of the mirror of the dressing table looking at herself with the hand glass she studied her profile first one side and then the other then she studied the back of her head and her neck don t you think it would be a good idea if i let my hair grow out she asked looking at her profile again george looked up and saw the back of her neck clipped close like a boy s i like it the way it is i get so tired of it she said i get so tired of looking like a boy george shifted his position in the bed he hadn t looked away from her since she started to speak you look pretty darn nice he said she laid the mirror down on the dresser and went over to the window and looked out it was getting dark i want to pull my hair back tight and smooth and make a big knot at the back that i can feel she said i want to have a kitty to sit on my lap and purr when i stroke her yeah george said from the bed and i want to eat at a table with my own silver and i want candles and i want it to be spring and i want to brush my hair out in front of a mirror and i want a kitty and i want some new clothes oh shut up and get something to read george said he was reading again his wife was looking out of the window it was quite dark now and still raining in the palm trees anyway i want a cat she said i want a cat i want a cat now if i can t have long hair or any fun i can have a cat george was not listening he was reading his book his wife looked out of the window where the light had come on in the square someone knocked at the door avanti george said he looked up from his book in the doorway stood the maid she held a big tortoise shell cat pressed tight against her and swung down against her body excuse me she said the padrone asked me to bring this for the signora chapter xi the crowd shouted all the time and threw pieces of bread down into the ring then cushions and leather wine bottles keeping up whistling and yelling finally the bull was too tired from so much bad sticking and folded his knees and lay down and one of the cuadrilla leaned out over his neck and killed him with the puntillo the crowd came over the barrera and around the torero and two men grabbed him and held him and some one cut of his pigtail and was waving it and a kid grabbed it and ran away with it afterwards i saw him at the café he was very short with a brown face and quite drunk and he said after all it has happened before like that i am not really a good bull fighter out of season on the four lire peduzzi had earned by spading the hotel garden he got quite drunk he saw the young gentleman coming down the path and spoke to him mysteriously the young gentleman said he had not eaten but would be ready to go as soon as lunch was finished forty minutes or an hour at the cantina near the bridge they trusted him for three more grappas because he was so confident and mysterious about his job for the afternoon it was a windy day with the sun coming out from behind clouds and then going under in sprinkles of rain a wonderful day for trout fishing the young gentleman came out of the hotel and asked him about the rods should his wife come behind with the rods yes said peduzzi let her follow us the young gentleman went back into the hotel and spoke to his wife he and peduzzi started down the road the young gentleman had a musette over his shoulder peduzzi saw the wife who looked as young as the young gentleman and was wearing mountain boots and a blue beret start out to follow them down the road carrying the fishing rods unjointed one in each hand peduzzi didn t like her to be way back there signorina he called winking at the young gentleman come up here and walk with us signora come up here let us all walk together peduzzi wanted them all three to walk down the street of cortina together the wife stayed behind following rather sullenly signorina peduzzi called tenderly come up here with us the young gentleman looked back and shouted something the wife stopped lagging behind and walked up everyone they met walking through the main street of the town peduzzi greeted elaborately buon dì arturo tipping his hat the bank clerk stared at him from the door of the fascist café groups of three and four people standing in front of the shops stared at the three the workmen in their stonepowdered jackets working on the foundations of the new hotel looked up as they passed nobody spoke or gave any sign to them except the town beggar lean and old with a spittle thickened beard who lifted his hat as they passed peduzzi stopped in front of a store with the window full of bottles and brought his empty grappa bottle from an inside pocket of his old military coat a little to drink some marsala for the signora something something to drink he gestured with the bottle it was a wonderful day marsala you like marsala signorina a little marsala the wife stood sullenly you ll have to play up to this she said i can t understand a word he says he s drunk isn t he the young gentleman appeared not to hear peduzzi he was thinking what in hell makes him say marsala that s what max beerbohm drinks geld peduzzi said finally taking hold of the young gentleman s sleeve lire he smiled reluctant to press the subject but needing to bring the young gentleman into action the young gentleman took out his pocketook and gave him a ten lira note peduzzi went up the steps to the door of the specialty of domestic and foreign wines shop it was locked it is closed until two someone passing in the street said scornfully peduzzi came down the steps he felt hurt never mind he said we can get it at the concordia they walked down the road to the concordia three abreast on the porch of the concordia where the rusty bobsleds were stacked the young gentleman said was wollen sie peduzzi handed him the ten lira note folded over and over nothing he said anything he was embarrassed marsala maybe i don t know marsala the door of the concordia shut on the young gentleman and the wife three marsalas said the young gentleman to the girl behind the pastry counter two you mean she asked no he said one for a vecchio oh she said a vecchio and laughed getting down the bottle she poured out the three muddy looking drinks into three glasses the wife was sitting at a table under the line of newspapers on sticks the young gentleman put one of the marsalas in front of her you might as well drink it he said maybe it ll make you feel better she sat and looked at the glass the young gentleman went outside the door with a glass for peduzzi but could not see him i don t know where he is he said coming back into the pastry room carrying the glass he wanted a quart of it said the wife how much is a quarter litre the young gentleman asked the girl of the bianco one lira no of the marsala put these two in too he said giving her his own glass and the one poured for peduzzi she filled the quarter litre wine measure with a funnel a bottle to carry it said the young gentleman she went to hunt for a bottle it all amused her i m sorry you feel so rotten tiny he said i m sorry i talked the way i did at lunch we were both getting at the same thing from different angles it doesn t make any difference she said none of it makes any difference are you too cold he asked i wish you d worn another sweater i ve got on three sweaters the girl came in with a very slim brown bottle and poured the marsala into it the young gentleman paid five lire more they went out the door the girl was amused peduzzi was walking up and down at the other end out of the wind and holding the rods come on he said i will carry the rods what difference does it make if anybody sees them no one will trouble us no one will make any trouble for me in cortina i know them at the municipio i have been a soldier everybody in this town likes me i sell frogs what if it is forbidden to fish not a thing nothing no trouble big trout i tell you lots of them they were walking down the hill toward the river the town was in back of them the sun had gone under and it was sprinkling rain there said peduzzi pointing to a girl in the doorway of a house they passed my daughter his doctor the wife said has he got to show us his doctor he said his daughter said the young gentleman the girl went into the house as peduzzi pointed they walked down the hill across the fields and then turned to follow the river bank peduzzi talked rapidly with much winking and knowingness as they walked three abreast the wife caught his breath across the wind once he nudged her in the ribs part of the time he talked in d ampezzo dialect and sometimes in tyroler german dialect he could not make out which the young gentleman and his wife understood the best so he was being bilingual but as the young gentleman said ja ja peduzzi decided to talk altogether in tyroler the young gentleman and the wife understood nothing everybody in the town saw us going through with these rods we re probably being followed by the game police now i wish we weren t in on this damn thing this damned old fool is so drunk too of course you haven t got the guts to just go back said the wife of course you have to go on why don t you go back go on back tiny i m going to stay with you if you go to jail we might as well both go they turned sharp down the bank and peduzzi stood his coat blowing in the wind gesturing at the river it was brown and muddy off on the right there was a dump heap say it to me in italian said the young gentleman un mezz ora piu d un mezz ora he says it s at least a half hour more go on back tiny you re cold in this wind anyway it s a rotten day and we aren t going to have any fun anyway all right she said and climbed up the grassy bank peduzzi was down at the river and did not notice her till she was almost out of sight over the crest frau he shouted frau fräulein you re not going she went on over the crest of the hill she s gone said peduzzi it shocked him he took off the rubber bands that held the rod segments together and commenced to joint up one of the rods but you said it was half an hour further oh yes it is good half an hour down it is good here too really of course it is good here and good there too the young gentleman sat down on the bank and jointed up a rod put on the reel and threaded the line through the guides he felt uncomfortable and afraid that any minute a gamekeeper or a posse of citizens would come over the bank from the town he could see the houses of the town and the campanile over the edge of the hill he opened his leader box peduzzi leaned over and dug his flat hard thumb and forefinger in and tangled the moistened leaders have you some lead no you must have some lead peduzzi was excited you must have piombo piombo a little piombo just here just above the hook or your bait will float on the water you must have it just a little piombo have you got some no he looked through his pockets desperately sifting through the cloth dirt in the linings of his inside military pockets i haven t any we must have piombo we can t fish then said the young gentleman and unjointed the rod reeling the line back through the guides we ll get some piombo and fish tomorrow but listen caro you must have piombo the line will lie flat on the water peduzzi s day was going to pieces before his eyes you must have piombo a little is enough your stuff is all clean and new but you have no lead i would have brought some you said you had everything the young gentleman looked at the stream discolored by the melting snow i know he said we ll get some piombo and fish tomorrow at what hour in the morning tell me that at seven the sun came out it was warm and pleasant the young gentleman felt relieved he was no longer breaking the law sitting on the bank he took the bottle of marsala out of his pocket and passed it to peduzzi peduzzi passed it back the young gentleman took a drink of it and passed it to peduzzi again peduzzi passed it back again drink he said drink it s your marsala after another short drink the young gentleman handed the bottle over peduzzi had been watching it closely he took the bottle very hurriedly and tipped it up the gray hairs in the folds of his neck oscillated as he drank his eyes fixed on the end of the narrow brown bottle he drank it all the sun shone while he drank it was wonderful this was a great day after all a wonderful day senta caro in the morning at seven he had called the young gentleman caro several times and nothing had happened it was good marsala his eyes glistened days like this stretched out ahead it would begin at seven in the morning they started to walk up the hill toward the town the young gentleman went on ahead he was quite a way up the hill peduzzi called to him listen caro can you let me take five lire for a favor for today asked the young gentleman frowning no not today give it to me today for tomorrow i will provide everything for tomorrow pane salami formaggio good stuff for all of us you and i and the signora bait for fishing minnows not worms only perhaps i can get some marsala all for five lire five lire for a favor the young gentleman looked through his pocketbook and took out a two lira note and two ones thank you caro thank you said peduzzi in the tone of one member of the carleton club accepting the morning post from another this was living he was through with the hotel garden breaking up frozen manure with a dung fork life was opening out until seven o clock then caro he said slapping the young gentleman on the back promptly at seven i may not be going said the young gentleman putting his purse back in his pocket what said peduzzi i will have minnows signor salami everything you and i and the signora the three of us i may not be going said the young gentleman very probably not i will leave word with the padrone at the hotel office chapter xii if it happened right down close in front of you you could see villalta snarl at the bull and curse him and when the bull charged he swung back firmly like an oak when the wind hits it his legs tight together the muleta trailing and the sword following the curve behind then he cursed the bull flopped the muleta at him and swung back from the charge his feet firm the muleta curving and at each swing the crowd roaring when he started to kill it was all in the same rush the bull looking at him straight in front hating he drew out the sword from the folds of the muleta and sighted with the same movement and called to the bull toro toro and the bull charged and villalta charged and just for a moment they became one villalta became one with the bull and then it was over villalta standing straight and the red hilt of the sword sticking out dully between the bull s shoulders villalta his hand up at the crowd and the bull roaring blood looking straight at villalta and his legs caving cross country snow the funicular car bucked once more and then stopped it could not go farther the snow drifted solidly across the track the gale scouring the exposed surface of the mountain had swept the snow surface into a wind board crust nick waxing his skis in the baggage car pushed his boots into the toe irons and shut the clamp tight he jumped from the car sideways onto the hard wind board made a jump turn and crouching and trailing his sticks slipped in a rush down the slope on the white below george dipped and rose and dipped out of sight the rush and the sudden swoop as he dropped down a steep undulation in the mountain side plucked nick s mind out and left him only the wonderful flying dropping sensation in his body he rose to a slight up run and then the snow seemed to drop out from under him as he went down down faster and faster in a rush down the last long steep slope crouching so he was almost sitting back on his skis trying to keep the center of gravity low the snow driving like a sand storm he knew the pace was too much but he held it he would not let go and spill then a patch of soft snow left in a hollow by the wind spilled him and he went over and over in a clashing of skis feeling like a shot rabbit then stuck his legs crossed his skis sticking straight up and his nose and ears jammed full of snow george stood a little farther down the slope knocking the snow from his wind jacket with big slaps you took a beauty mike he called to nick that s lousy soft snow it bagged me the same way what s it like over the khud nick kicked his skis around as he lay on his back and stood up you ve got to keep to your left it s a good fast drop with a christy at the bottom on account of a fence wait a sec and we ll take it together no you come on and go first i like to see you take the khuds nick adams came up past george big back and blond head still faintly snowy then his skis started slipping at the edge and he swooped down hissing in the crystalline powder snow and seeming to float up and drop down as he went up and down the billowing khuds he held to his left and at the end as he rushed toward the fence keeping his knees locked tight together and turning his body like tightening a screw brought his skis sharply around to the right in a smother of snow and slowed into a loss of speed parallel to the hillside and the wire fence he looked up the hill george was coming down in telemark position kneeling one leg forward and bent the other trailing his sticks hanging like some insect s thin legs kicking up puffs of snow as they touched the surface and finally the whole kneeling trailing figure coming around in a beautiful right curve crouching the legs shot forward and back the body leaning out against the swing the sticks accenting the curve like points of light all in a wild cloud of snow i was afraid to christy george said the snow was too deep you made a beauty i can t telemark with my leg nick said nick held down the top strand of the wire fence with his ski and george slid over nick followed him down to the road they thrust bent kneed along the road into a pine forest the road became polished ice stained orange and a tobacco yellow from the teams hauling logs the skiers kept to the stretch of snow along the side the road dipped sharply to a stream and then ran straight up hill through the woods they could see a long low eaved weather beaten building through the trees it was a faded yellow closer the window frames were painted green the paint was peeling nick knocked his clamps loose with one of his ski sticks and kicked off the skis we might as well carry them up here he said he climbed the steep road with the skis on his shoulder kicking his heel nails into the icy footing he heard george breathing and kicking in his heels just behind him they stacked the skis against the side of the inn and slapped the snow off each other s trousers stamped their boots clean and went in inside it was quite dark a big porcelain stove shone in the corner of the room there was a low ceiling smooth benches back of dark wine stained tables were along each side of the rooms two swiss sat over their pipes and two decies of cloudy new wine next to the stove the boys took off their jackets and sat against the wall on the other side of the stove a voice in the next room stopped singing and a girl in a blue apron came in through the door to see what they wanted to drink a bottle of sion nick said is that all right gidge sure said george you know more about wine than i do i like any of it the girl went out there s nothing really can touch skiing is there nick said the way it feels when you first drop off on a long run huh said george it s too swell to talk about the girl brought the wine in and they had trouble with the cork nick finally opened it the girl went out and they heard her singing in german in the next room those specks of cork in it don t matter said nick i wonder if she s got any cake let s find out the girl came in and nick noticed that her apron covered swellingly her pregnancy i wonder why i didn t see that when she first came in he thought what were you singing he asked her opera german opera she did not care to discuss the subject we have some apple strudel if you want it she isn t so cordial is she said george oh well she doesn t know us and she thought we were going to kid her about her singing maybe she s from up where they speak german probably and she s touchy about being here and then she s got that baby coming without being married and she s touchy how do you know she isn t married no ring hell no girls get married around here till they re knocked up the door came open and a gang of woodcutters from up the road came in stamping their boots and steaming in the room the waitress brought in three litres of new wine for the gang and they sat at the two tables smoking and quiet with their hats off leaning back against the wall or forward on the table outside the horses on the wood sledges made an occasional sharp jangle of bells as they tossed their heads george and nick were happy they were fond of each other they knew they had the run back home ahead of them when have you got to go back to school nick asked tonight george answered i ve got to get the ten forty from montreux i wish you could stick over and we could do the dent du lys tomorrow i got to get educated george said gee mike don t you wish we could just bum together take our skis and go on the train to where there was good running and then go on and put up at pubs and go right across the oberland and up the valais and all through the engadine and just take repair kit and extra sweaters and pyjamas in our rucksacks and not give a damn about school or anything yes and go through the schwarzwald that way gee the swell places that s where you went fishing last summer isn t it yes they ate the strudel and drank the rest of the wine george leaned back against the wall and shut his eyes wine always makes me feel this way he said feel bad nick asked no i feel good but funny i know nick said sure said george should we have another bottle nick asked not for me george said they sat there nick leaning his elbows on the table george slumped back against the wall is helen going to have a baby george said coming down to the table from the wall yes

george said nick stood up he buckled his wind jacket tight he leaned over george and picked up the two ski poles from against the wall he stuck one of the ski poles into the floor there isn t any good in promising he said they opened the door and went out it was very cold the snow had crusted hard the road ran up the hill into the pine trees they took down their skis from where they leaned against the wall in the inn nick put on his gloves george was already started up the road his skis on his shoulder now they would have the run home together chapter xiii i heard the drums coming down the street and then the fifes and the pipes and then they came around the corner all dancing the street was full of them maera saw him and then i saw him when they stopped the music for the crouch he hunched down in the street with them all and when they started it again he jumped up and went dancing down the street with them he was drunk all right you go down after him said maera he hates me so i went down and caught up with them and grabbed him while he was crouched down waiting for the music to break loose and said come on luis for christ s sake you ve got bulls this afternoon he didn t listen to me he was listening so hard for the music to start i said don t be a damn fool luis come on back to the hotel then the music started up again and he jumped up and twisted away from me and started dancing i grabbed his arm and he pulled loose and said oh leave me alone you re not my father i went back to the hotel and maera was on the balcony looking out to see if i d be bringing him back he went inside when he saw me and came downstairs disgusted well i said after all he s just an ignorant mexican savage yes maera said and who will kill his bulls after he gets a cogida we i suppose i said yes we said maera we kills the savages bulls and the drunkards bulls and the riau riau dancers bulls yes we kill them we kill them all right yes yes yes my old man i guess looking at it now my old man was cut out for a fat guy one of those regular little roly fat guys you see around but he sure never got that way except a little toward the last and then it wasn t his fault he was riding over the jumps only and he could afford to carry plenty of weight then i remember the way he d pull on a rubber shirt over a couple of jerseys and a big sweat shirt over that and get me to run with him in the forenoon in the hot sun he d have maybe taken a trial trip with one of razzo s skins early in the morning after just getting in from torino at four o clock in the morning and beating it out to the stables in a cab and then with the dew all over everything and the sun just starting to get going i d help him pull off his boots and he d get into a pair of sneakers and all these sweaters and we d start out come on kid he d say stepping up and down on his toes in front of the jock s dressing room let s get moving then we d start off jogging around the infield once maybe with him ahead running nice and then turn out the gate and along one of those roads with all the trees along both sides of them that run out from san siro i d go ahead of him when we hit the road and i could run pretty good and i d look around and he d be jogging easy just behind me and after a little while i d look around again and he d begun to sweat sweating heavy and he d just be dogging it along with his eyes on my back but when he d catch me looking at him he d grin and say sweating plenty when my old man grinned nobody could help but grin too we d keep right on running out toward the mountains and then my old man would yell hey joe and i d look back and he d be sitting under a tree with a towel he d had around his waist wrapped around his neck i d come back and sit down beside him and he d pull a rope out of his pocket and start skipping rope out in the sun with the sweat pouring off his face and him skipping rope out in the white dust with the rope going cloppetty cloppetty clop clop clop and the sun hotter and him working harder up and down a patch of the road say it was a treat to see my old man skip rope too he could whirr it fast or lop it slow and fancy say you ought to have seen wops look at us sometimes when they d come by going into town walking along with big white steers hauling the cart they sure looked as though they thought the old man was nuts he d start the rope whirring till they d stop dead still and watch him then give the steers a cluck and a poke with the goad and get going again when i d sit watching him working out in the hot sun i sure felt fond of him he sure was fun and he done his work so hard and he d finish up with a regular whirring that d drive the sweat out on his face like water and then sling the rope at the tree and come over and sit down with me and lean back against the tree with the towel and a sweater wrapped around his neck sure is hell keeping it down joe he d say and lean back and shut his eyes and breathe long and deep it ain t like when you re a kid then he d get up and before he started to cool we d jog along back to the stables that s the way it was keeping down to weight he was worried all the time most jocks can just about ride off all they want to a jock loses about a kilo every time he rides but my old man was sort of dried out and he couldn t keep down his kilos without all that running i remember once at san siro regoli a little wop that was riding for buzoni came out across the paddock going to the bar for something cool and flicking his boots with his whip after he d just weighed in and my old man had just weighed in too and came out with the saddle under his arm looking red faced and tired and too big for his silks and he stood there looking at young regoli standing up to the outdoors bar cool and kid looking and i said what s the matter dad cause i thought maybe regoli had bumped him or something and he just looked at regoli and said oh to hell with it and went on to the dressing room well it would have been all right maybe if we d stayed in milan and ridden at milan and torino cause if there ever were any easy courses it s those two pianola joe my old man said when he dismounted in the winning stall after what the wops thought was a hell of a steeplechase i asked him once this course rides itself it s the pace you re going at that makes riding the jumps dangerous joe we ain t going any pace here and they ain t really bad jumps either but it s the pace always not the jumps that makes the trouble san siro was the swellest course i d ever seen but the old man said it was a dog s life going back and forth between mirafiore and san siro and riding just about every day in the week with a train ride every other night i was nuts about the horses too there s something about it when they come out and go up the track to the post sort of dancy and tight looking with the jock keeping a tight hold on them and maybe easing off a little and letting them run a little going up then once they were at the barrier it got me worse than anything especially at san siro with that big green infield and the mountains way off and the fat wop starter with his big whip and the jocks fiddling them around and then the barrier snapping up and that bell going off and them all getting off in a bunch and then commencing to string out you know the way a bunch of skins gets off if you re up in the stand with a pair of glasses all you see is them plunging off and then that bell goes off and it seems like it rings for a thousand years and then they come sweeping round the turn there wasn t ever anything like it for me but my old man said one day in the dressing room when he was getting into his street clothes none of these things are horses joe they d kill that bunch of skates for their hides and hoofs up at paris that was the day he d won the premio commercio with lantorna shooting her out of the field the last hundred meters like pulling a cork out of a bottle it was right after the premio commercio that we pulled out and left italy my old man and holbrook and a fat wop in a straw hat that kept wiping his face with a handkerchief were having an argument at a table in the galleria they were all talking french and the two of them was after my old man about something finally he didn t say anything any more but just sat there and looked at holbrook and the two of them kept after him first one talking and then the other and the fat wop always butting in on holbrook you go out and buy me a sportsman will you joe my old man said and handed me a couple of soldi without looking away from holbrook so i went out of the galleria and walked over to in front of the scala and bought a paper and came back and stood a little way away because i didn t want to butt in and my old man was sitting back in his chair looking down at his coffee and fooling with a spoon and holbrook and the big wop were standing and the big wop was wiping his face and shaking his head and i came up and my old man acted just as though the two of them weren t standing there and said want an ice joe holbrook looked down at my old man and said slow and careful you son of a bitch and he and the fat wop went out through the tables my old man sat there and son of smiled at me but his face was white and he looked sick as hell and i was scared and felt sick inside because i knew something had happened and i didn t see how anybody could call my old man a son of a bitch and get away with it my old man opened up the sportsman and studied the handicaps for a while and then he said you got to take a lot of things in this world joe and three days later we left milan for good on the turin train for paris after an auction sale out in front of turner s stables of everything we couldn t get into a trunk and a suit case we got into paris early in the morning in a long dirty station the old man told me was the gare de lyon paris was an awful big town after milan seems like in milan everybody is going somewhere and all the trams run somewhere and there ain t any sort of a mix up but paris is all balled up and they never do straighten it out i got to like it though part of it anyway and say it s got the best race courses in the world seems as though that were the thing that keeps it all going and about the only thing you can figure on is that every day the buses will be going out to whatever track they re running at going right out through everything to the track i never really got to know paris well because i just came in about once or twice a week with the old man from maisons and he always sat at the café de la paix on the opera side with the rest of the gang from maisons and i guess that s one of the busiest parts of the town but say it is funny that a big town like paris wouldn t have a galleria isn t it well we went out to live at maisons lafitte where just about everybody lives except the gang at chantilly with a mrs meyers that runs a boarding house maisons is about the swellest place to live i ve ever seen in all my life the town ain t so much but there s a lake and a swell forest that we used to go off bumming in all day a couple of us kids and my old man made me a sling shot and we got a lot of things with it but the best one was a magpie young dick atkinson shot a rabbit with it one day and we put it under a tree and were all sitting around and dick had some cigarettes and all of a sudden the rabbit jumped up and beat it into the brush and we chased it but we couldn t find it gee we had fun at maisons mrs meyers used to give me lunch in the morning and i d be gone all day i learned to talk french quick it s an easy language as soon as we got to maisons my old man wrote to milan for his license and he was pretty worried till it came he used to sit around the café de paris in maisons with the gang there were lots of guys he d known when he rode up at paris before the war lived at maisons and there s a lot of time to sit around because the work around a racing stable for the jocks that is is all cleaned up by nine o clock in the morning they take the first bunch of skins out to gallop them at 5 30 in the morning and they work the second lot at 8 o clock that means getting up early all right and going to bed early too if a jock s riding for somebody too he can t go boozing around because the trainer always has an eye on him if he s a kid and if he ain t a kid he s always got an eye on himself so mostly if a jock ain t working he sits around the café de paris with the gang and they can all sit around about two or three hours in front of some drink like a vermouth and seltz and they talk and tell stories and shoot pool and it s sort of like a club or the galleria in milan only it ain t really like the galleria because there everybody is going by all the time and there s everybody around at the tables well my old man got his license all right they sent it through to him without a word and he rode a couple of times amiens up country and that sort of thing but he didn t seem to get any engagement everybody liked him and whenever i d come into the café in the forenoon i d find somebody drinking with him because my old man wasn t tight like most of these jockeys that have got the first dollar they made riding at the world s fair in st louis in nineteen ought four that s what my old man would say when he d kid george burns but it seemed like everybody steered clear of giving my old man any mounts we went out to wherever they were runnning every day with the car from maisons and that was the most fun of all i was glad when the horses came back from deauville and the summer even though it meant no more bumming in the woods cause then we d ride to enghien or tremblay or st cloud and watch them from the trainers and jockeys stand i sure learned about racing from going out with that gang and the fun of it was going every day i remember once out at st cloud it was a big two hundred thousand franc race with seven entries and kzar a big favorite i went around to the paddock to see the horses with my old man and you never saw such horses this kzar is a great big yellow horse that looks like just nothing but run i never saw such a horse he was being led around the paddocks with his head down and when he went by me i felt all hollow inside he was so beautiful there never was such a wonderful lean running built horse and he went around the paddock putting his feet just so and quiet and careful and moving easy like he knew just what he had to do and not jerking and standing up on his legs and getting wild eyed like you see these selling platers with a shot of dope in them the crowd was so thick i couldn t see him again except just his legs going by and some yellow and my old man started out through the crowd and i followed him over to the jock s dressing room back in the trees and there was a big crowd around there too but the man at the door in a derby nodded to my old man and we got in and everybody was sitting around and getting dressed and pulling shirts over their heads and pulling boots on and it all smelled hot and sweaty and linimenty and outside was the crowd looking in the old man went over and sat down beside george gardner that was getting into his pants and said what s the dope george just in an ordinary tone of voice cause there ain t any use him feeling around because george either can tell him or he can t tell him he won t win george says very low leaning over and buttoning the bottoms of his breeches who will my old man says leaning over close so nobody can hear kircubbin george says and if he does save me a couple of tickets my old man says something in a regular voice to george and george says don t ever bet on anything i tell you kidding like and we beat it out and through all the crowd that was looking in over to the 100 franc mutuel machine but i knew something big was up because george is kzar s jockey on the way he gets one of the yellow odds sheets with the starting prices on and kzar is only paying 5 for 10 cefisidote is next at 3 to 1 and fifth down the list this kircubbin at 8 to 1 my old man bets five thousand on kircubbin to win and puts on a thousand to place and we went around back of the grandstand to go up the stairs and get a place to watch the race we were jammed in tight and first a man in a long coat with a gray tall hat and a whip folded up in his hand came out and then one after another the horses with the jocks up and a stable boy holding the bridle on each side and walking along followed the old guy that big yellow horse kzar came first he didn t look so big when you first looked at him until you saw the length of his legs and the whole way he s built and the way he moves gosh i never saw such a horse george gardner was riding him and they moved along slow back of the old guy in the gray tall hat that walked along like he was a ring master in a circus back of kzar moving along smooth and yellow in the sun was a good looking black with a nice head with tommy archibald riding him and after the black was a string of five more horses all moving along slow in a procession past the grandstand and the pesage my old man said the black was kircubbin and i took a good look at him and he was a nice looking horse all right but nothing like kzar everybody cheered kzar when he went by and he sure was one swell looking horse the procession of them went around on the other side past the pelouse and then back up to the near end of the course and the circus master had the stable boys turn them loose one after another so they could gallop by the stands on their way up to the post and let everybody have a good look at them they weren t at the post hardly any time at all when the gong started and you could see them way off across the infield all in a bunch starting on the first swing like a lot of little toy horses i was watching them through the glasses and kzar was running well back with one of the bays making the pace they swept down and around and came pounding past and kzar was way back when they passed us and this kircubbin horse in front and going smooth gee it s awful when they go by you and then you have to watch them go farther away and get smaller and smaller and then all bunched up on the turns and then come around towards into the stretch and you feel like swearing and god damming worse and worse finally they made the last turn and came into the straightaway with this kircubbin horse way out in front everybody was looking funny and saying kzar in sort of a sick way and them pounding nearer down the stretch and then something came out of the pack right into my glasses like a horseheaded yellow streak and everybody began to yell kzar as though they were crazy kzar came on faster than i d ever seen anything in my life and pulled up on kircubbin that was going fast as any black horse could go with the jock flogging hell out of him with the gad and they were right dead neck and neck for a second but kzar seemed going about twice as fast with those great jumps and that head out but it was while they were neck and neck that they passed the winning post and when the numbers went up in the slots the first one was 2 and that meant that kircubbin had won i felt all trembly and funny inside and then we were all jammed in with the people going downstairs to stand in front of the board where they d post what kircubbin paid honest watching the race i d forgot how much my old man had bet on kircubbin i d wanted kzar to win so damned bad but now it was all over it was swell to know we had the winner wasn t it a swell race dad i said to him he looked at me sort of funny with his derby on the back of his head george gardner s a swell jockey all right he said it sure took a great jock to keep that kzar horse from winning of course i knew it was funny all the time but my old man saying that right out like that sure took the kick all out of it for me and i didn t get the real kick back again ever even when they posted the numbers upon the board and the bell rang to pay off and we saw that kircubbin paid 67 50 for 10 all round people were saying poor kzar poor kzar and i thought i wish i were a jockey and could have rode him instead of that son of a bitch and that was funny thinking of george gardner as a son of a bitch because i d always liked him and besides he d given us the winner but i guess that s what he is all right my old man had a big lot of money after that race and he took to coming into paris oftener if they raced at tremblay he d have them drop him in town on their way back to maisons and he and i d sit out in front of the café de la paix and watch the people go by it s funny sitting there there s streams of people going by and all sorts of guys come up and want to sell you things and i loved to sit there with my old man that was when we d have the most fun guys would come by selling funny rabbits that jumped if you squeezed a bulb and they d come up to us and my old man would kid with them he could talk french just like english and all those kind of guys knew him cause you can always tell a jockey and then we always sat at the same table and they got used to seeing us there there were guys selling matrimonial papers and girls selling rubber eggs that when you squeezed them a rooster came out of them and one old wormy looking guy that went by with post cards of paris showing them to everybody and of course nobody ever bought any and then he would come back and show the under side of the pack and they would all be smutty postcards and lots of people would dig down and buy them gee i remember the funny people that used to go by girls around supper time looking for somebody to take them out to eat and they d speak to my old man and he d make some joke at them in french and they d pat me on the head and go on once there was an american woman sitting with her kid daughter at the next table to us and they were both eating ices and i kept looking at the girl and she was awfully good looking and i smiled at her and she smiled at me but that was all that ever came of it because i looked for her mother and her every day and i made up ways that i was going to speak to her and i wondered if i got to know her if her mother would let me take her out to auteuil or tremblay but i never saw either of them again anyway i guess it wouldn t have been any good anyway because looking back on it i remember the way i thought out would be best to speak to her was to say pardon me but perhaps i can give you a winner at enghien today and after all maybe she would have thought i was a tout instead of really trying to give her a winner we d sit at the café de la paix my old man and me and we had a big drag with the waiter because my old man drank whisky and it cost five francs and that meant a good tip when the saucers were counted up my old man was drinking more than i d ever seen him but he wasn t riding at all now and besides he said that whisky kept his weight down but i noticed he was putting it on all right just the same he d busted away from his old gang out at maisons and seemed to like just sitting around on the boulevard with me but he was dropping money every day at the track he d feel sort of doleful after the last race if he d lost on the day until we d get to our table and he d have his first whisky and then he d be fine he d be reading the paris sport and he d look over at me and say where s your girl joe to kid me on account i had told him about the girl that day at the next table and i d get red but i liked being kidded about her it gave me a good feeling keep your eye peeled for her joe he d say she ll be back he d ask me questions about things and some of the things i d say he d laugh and then he d get started talking about things about riding down in egypt or at st moritz on the ice before my mother died and about during the war when they had regular races down in the south of france without any purses or betting or crowd or anything just to keep the breed up regular races with the jocks riding hell out of the horses gee i could listen to my old man talk by the hour especially when he d had a couple or so of drinks he d tell me about when he was a boy in kentucky and going coon hunting and the old days in the states before everything went on the bum there and he d say joe when we ve got a decent stake you re going back there to the states and go to school what ve i got to go back there to go to school for when everything s on the bum there i d ask him that s different he d say and get the waiter over and pay the pile of saucers and we d get a taxi to the gare st lazare and get on the train out to maisons one day at auteuil after a selling steeplechase my old man bought in the winner for 30 000 francs he had to bid a little to get him but the stable let the horse go finally and my old man had his permit and his colors in a week gee i felt proud when my old man was an owner he fixed it up for stable space with charles drake and cut out coming in to paris and started his running and sweating out again and him and i were the whole stable gang our horse s name was gilford he was irish bred and a nice sweet jumper my old man figured that training him and riding him himself he was a good investment i was proud of everything and i thought gilford was as good a horse as kzar he was a good solid jumper a bay with plenty of speed on the flat if you asked him for it and he was a nicelooking horse too gee i was fond of him the first time he started with my old man up he finished third in a 2500 meter hurdle race and when my old man got off him all sweating and happy in the place stall and went in to weigh i felt as proud of him as though it was the first race he d ever placed in you see when a guy ain t been riding for a long time you can t make yourself really believe that he has ever rode the whole thing was different now cause down in milan even big races never seemed to make any difference to my old man if he won he wasn t ever excited or anything and now it was so i couldn t hardly sleep the night before a race and i knew my old man was excited too even if he didn t show it riding for yourself makes an awful difference second time gilford and my old man started was a rainy sunday at auteuil in the prix du marat a 4500 meter steeplechase as soon as he d gone out i beat it up in the stand with the new glasses my old man had bought for me to watch them they started way over at the far end of the course and there was some trouble at the barrier something with goggle blinders on was making a great fuss and rearing around and busted the barrier once but i could see my old man in our black jacket with a white cross and a black cap sitting up on gilford and patting him with his hand then they were off in a jump and out of sight behind the trees and the gong going for dear life and the parimutuel wickets rattling down gosh i was so excited i was afraid to look at them but i fixed the glasses on the place where they would come out back of the trees and then out they came with the old black jacket going third and they all sailing over the jump like birds then they went out of sight again and then they came pounding out and down the hill and all going nice and sweet and easy and taking the fence smooth in a bunch and moving away from us all solid looked as though you could walk across on their backs they were all so bunched and going so smooth then they bellied over the big double bullfinch and something came down i couldn t see who it was but in a minute the horse was up and galloping free and the field all bunched still sweeping around the long left turn into the straightaway they jumped the stone wall and came jammed down the stretch toward the big waterjump right in front of the stands i saw them coming and hollered at my old man as he went by and he was leading by about a length and riding way out and light as a monkey and they were racing for the water jump they took off over the big hedge of the water jump in a pack and then there was a crash and two horses pulled sideways out off it and kept on going and three others were piled up i couldn t see my old man anywhere one horse kneed himself up and the jock had hold of the bridle and mounted and went slamming on after the place money the other horse was up and away by himself jerking his head and galloping with the bridle rein hanging and the jock staggered over to one side of the track against the fence then gilford rolled over to one side off my old man and got up and started to run on three legs with his front off hoof dangling and there was my old man laying there on the grass flat out with his face up and blood all over the side of his head i ran down the stand and bumped into a jam of people and got to the rail and a cop grabbed me and held me and two big stretcher bearers were going out after my old man and around on the other side of the course i saw three horses strung way out coming out of the trees and taking the jump my old man was dead when they brought him in and while a doctor was listening to his heart with a thing plugged in his ears i heard a shot up the track that meant they d killed gilford i lay down beside my old man when they carried the stretcher into the hospital room and hung onto the stretcher and cried and cried and he looked so white and gone and so awfully dead and i couldn t help feeling that if my old man was dead maybe they didn t need to have shot gilford his hoof might have got well i don t know i loved my old man so much then a couple of guys came in and one of them patted me on the back and then went over and looked at my old man and then pulled a sheet off the cot and spread it over him and the other was telephoning in french for them to send the ambulance to take him out to maisons and i couldn t stop crying crying and choking sort of and george gardner came in and sat down beside me on the floor and put his arm around me and says come on joe old boy get up and we ll go out and wait for the ambulance george and i went out to the gate and i was trying to stop bawling and george wiped off my face with his handkerchief and we were standing back a little ways while the crowd was going out of the gate and a couple of guys stopped near us while we were waiting for the crowd to get through the gate and one of them was counting a bunch of mutuel tickets and he said well butler got his all right the other guy said i don t give a good goddam if he did the crook he had it coming to him on the stuff he s pulled i ll say he had said the other guy and tore the bunch of tickets in two and george gardner looked at me to see if i d heard and i had all right and he said don t you listen to what those bums said joe your old man was one swell guy but i don t know seems like when they get started they don t leave a guy nothing chapter xiv maera lay still his head on his arms his face in the sand he felt warm and sticky from the bleeding each time he felt the horn coming sometimes the bull only bumped him with his head once the horn went all the way through him and he felt it go into the sand some one had the bull by the tail they were swearing at him and flopping the cape in his face then the bull was gone some men picked maera up and started to run with him toward the barriers through the gate out the passageway around under the grandstand to the infirmary they laid maera down on a cot and one of the men went out for the doctor the others stood around the doctor came running from the corral where he had been sewing up picador horses he had to stop and wash his hands there was a great shouting going on in the grandstand overhead maera felt everything getting larger and larger and then smaller and smaller then it got larger and larger and larger and then smaller and smaller then everything commenced to run faster and faster as when they speed up a cinematograph film then he was dead big two hearted river part i the train went on up the track out of sight around one of the hills of burnt timber nick sat down on the bundle of canvas and bedding the baggage man had pitched out of the door of the baggage car there was no town nothing but the rails and the burnedover country the thirteen saloons that had lined the one street of seney had not left a trace the foundations of the mansion house hotel stuck up above the ground the stone was chipped and split by the fire it was all that was left of the town of seney even the surface had been burned off the ground nick looked at the burned over stretch of hillside where he had expected to find the scattered houses of the town and then walked down the railroad track to the bridge over the river the river was there it swirled against the log spiles of the bridge nick looked down into the clear brown water colored from the pebbly bottom and watched the trout keeping themselves steady in the current with wavering fins as he watched them they changed their positions by quick angles only to hold steady in the fast water again nick watched them a long time he watched them holding themselves with their noses into the current many trout in deep fast moving water slightly distorted as he watched far down through the glassy convex surface of the pool its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log driven piles of the bridge at the bottom of the pool were the big trout nick did not see them at first then he saw them at the bottom of the pool big trout looking to hold themselves on the gravel bottom in a varying mist of gravel and sand raised in spurts by the current nick looked down into the pool from the bridge it was a hot day a kingfisher flew up the stream it was a long time since nick had looked into a stream and seen trout they were very satisfactory as the shadow of the kingfisher moved up the stream a big trout shot upstream in a long angle only his shadow marking the angle then lost his shadow as he came through the surface of the water caught the sun and then as he went back into the stream under the surface his shadow seemed to float down the stream with the current unresisting to his post under the bridge where he tightened facing up into the current nick s heart tightened as the trout moved he felt all the old feeling he turned and looked down the stream it stretched away pebbly bottomed with shallows and big boulders and a deep pool as it curved away around the foot of a bluff nick walked back up the ties to where his pack lay in the cinders beside the railway track he was happy he adjusted the pack harness around the bundle pulling straps tight slung the pack on his back got his arms through the shoulder straps and took some of the pull off his shoulders by leaning his forehead against the wide band of the tump line still it was too heavy it was much too heavy he had his leather rod case in his hand and leaning forward to keep the weight of the pack high on his shoulders he walked along the road that paralleled the railway track leaving the burned town behind in the heat and then turned off around a hill with a high fire scarred hill on either side onto a road that went back into the country he walked along the road feeling the ache from the pull of the heavy pack the road climbed steadily it was hard work walking up hill his muscles ached and the day was hot but nick felt happy he felt he had left everything behind the need for thinking the need to write other needs it was all back of him from the time he had gotten down off the train and the baggage man had thrown his pack out of the open car door things had been different seney was burned the country was burned over and changed but it did not matter it could not all be burned he knew that he hiked along the road sweating in the sun climbing to cross the range of hills that separated the railway from the pine plains the road ran on dipping occasionally but always climbing nick went on up finally the road after going parallel to the burnt hillside reached the top nick leaned back against a stump and slipped out of the pack harness ahead of him as far as he could see was the pine plain the burned country stopped off at the left with the range of hills on ahead islands of dark pine trees rose out of the plain far off to the left was the line of the river nick followed it with his eye and caught glints of the water in the sun there was nothing but the pine plain ahead of him until the far blue hills that marked the lake superior height of land he could hardly see them faint and far away in the heat light over the plain if he looked too steadily they were gone but if he only half looked they were there the far off hills of the height of land nick sat down against the charred stump and smoked a cigarette his pack balanced on the top of the stump harness holding ready a hollow molded in it from his back nick sat smoking looking out over the country he did not need to get his map out he knew where he was from the position of the river as he smoked his legs stretched out in front of him he noticed a grasshopper walk along the ground and up onto his woolen sock the grasshopper was black as he had walked along the road climbing he had started many grasshoppers from the dust they were all black they were not the big grasshoppers with yellow and black or red and black wings whirring out from their black wing sheathing as they fly up these were just ordinary hoppers but all a sooty black in color nick had wondered about them as he walked without really thinking about them now as he watched the black hopper that was nibbling at the wool of his sock with its fourway lip he realized that they had all turned black from living in the burned over land he realized that the fire must have come the year before but the grasshoppers were all black now he wondered how long they would stay that way carefully he reached his hand down and took hold of the hopper by the wings he turned him up all his legs walking in the air and looked at his jointed belly yes it was black too iridescent where the back and head were dusty go on hopper nick said speaking out loud for the first time fly away somewhere he tossed the grasshopper up into the air and watched him sail away to a charcoal stump across the road nick stood up he leaned his back against the weight of his pack where it rested upright on the stump and got his arms through the shoulder straps he stood with the pack on his back on the brow of the hill looking out across the country toward the distant river and then struck down the hillside away from the road underfoot the ground was good walking two hundred yards down the hillside the fire line stopped then it was sweet fern growing ankle high to walk through and clumps of jack pines a long undulating country with frequent rises and descents sandy underfoot and the country alive again nick kept his direction by the sun he knew where he wanted to strike the river and he kept on through the pine plain mounting small rises to see other rises ahead of him and sometimes from the top of a rise a great solid island of pines off to his right or his left he broke off some sprigs of the heathery sweet fern and put them under his pack straps the chafing crushed it and he smelled it as he walked he was tired and very hot walking across the uneven shadeless pine plain at any time he knew he could strike the river by turning off to his left it could not be more than a mile away but he kept on toward the north to hit the river as far upstream as he could go in one day s walking for some time as he walked nick had been in sight of one of the big islands of pine standing out above the rolling high ground he was crossing he dipped down and then as he came slowly up to the crest of the bridge he turned and made toward the pine trees there was no underbrush in the island of pine trees the trunks of the trees went straight up or slanted toward each other the trunks were straight and brown without branches the branches were high above some interlocked to make a solid shadow on the brown forest floor around the grove of trees was a bare space it was brown and soft underfoot as nick walked on it this was the overlapping of the pine needle floor extending out beyond the width of the high branches the trees had grown tall and the branches moved high leaving in the sun this bare space they had once covered with shadow sharp at the edge of this extension of the forest floor commenced the sweet fern nick slipped off his pack and lay down in the shade he lay on his back and looked up into the pine trees his neck and back and the small of his back rested as he stretched the earth felt good against his back he looked up at the sky through the branches and then shut his eyes he opened them and looked up again there was a wind high up in the branches he shut his eyes again and went to sleep nick woke stiff and cramped the sun was nearly down his pack was heavy and the straps painful as he lifted it on he leaned over with the pack on and picked up the leather rod case and started out from the pine trees across the sweet fern swale toward the river he knew it could not be more than a mile he came down a hillside covered with stumps into a meadow at the edge of the meadow flowed the river nick was glad to get to the river he walked upstream through the meadow his trousers were soaked with the dew as he walked after the hot day the dew had come quickly and heavily the river made no sound it was too fast and smooth at the edge of the meadow before he mounted to a piece of high ground to make camp nick looked down the river at the trout rising they were rising to insects come from the swamp on the other side of the stream when the sun went down the trout jumped out of water to take them while nick walked through the little stretch of meadow alongside the stream trout had jumped high out of water now as he looked down the river the insects must be settling on the surface for the trout were feeding steadily all down the stream as far down the long stretch as he could see the trout were rising making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were starting to rain the ground rose wooded and sandy to overlook the meadow the stretch of river and the swamp nick dropped his pack and rod case and looked for a level piece of ground he was very hungry and he wanted to make his camp before he cooked between two jack pines the ground was quite level he took the ax out of the pack and chopped out two projecting roots that leveled a piece of ground large enough to sleep on he smoothed out the sandy soil with his hand and pulled all the sweet fern bushes by their roots his hands smelled good from the sweet fern he smoothed the uprooted earth he did not want anything making lumps under the blankets when he had the ground smooth he spread his three blankets one he folded double next to the ground the other two he spread on top with the ax he slit off a bright slab of pine from one of the stumps and split it into pegs for the tent he wanted them long and solid to hold in the ground with the tent unpacked and spread on the ground the pack leaning against a jackpine looked much smaller nick tied the rope that served the tent for a ridge pole to the trunk of one of the pine trees and pulled the tent up off the ground with the other end of the rope and tied it to the other pine the tent hung on the rope like a canvas blanket on a clothesline nick poked a pole he had cut up under the back peak of the canvas and then made it a tent by pegging out the sides he pegged the sides out taut and drove the pegs deep hitting them down into the ground with the flat of the ax until the rope loops were buried and the canvas was drum tight across the open mouth of the tent nick fixed cheesecloth to keep out mosquitoes he crawled inside under the mosquito bar with various things from the pack to put at the head of the bed under the slant of the canvas inside the tent the light came through the brown canvas it smelled pleasantly of canvas already there was something mysterious and homelike nick was happy as he crawled inside the tent he had not been unhappy all day this was different though now things were done there had been this to do now it was done it had been a hard trip he was very tired that was done he had made his camp he was settled nothing could touch him it was a good place to camp he was there in the good place he was in his home where he had made it now he was hungry he came out crawling under the cheesecloth it was quite dark outside it was lighter in the tent nick went over to the pack and found with his fingers a long nail in a paper sack of nails in the bottom of the pack he drove it into the pine tree holding it close and hitting it gently with the flat of the ax he hung the pack up on the nail all his supplies were in the pack they were off the ground and sheltered now nick was hungry he did not believe he had ever been hungrier he opened and emptied a can of pork and beans and a can of spaghetti into the frying pan i ve got a right to eat this kind of stuff if i m willing to carry it nick said his voice sounded strange in the darkening woods he did not speak again he started a fire with some chunks of pine he got with the ax from a stump over the fire he stuck a wire grill pushing the four legs down into the ground with his boot nick put the frying pan on the grill over the flames he was hungrier the beans and spaghetti warmed nick stirred them and mixed them together they began to bubble making little bubbles that rose with difficulty to the surface there was a good smell nick got out a bottle of tomato catchup and cut four slices of bread the little bubbles were coming faster now nick sat down beside the fire and lifted the frying pan off he poured about half the contents out into the tin plate it spread slowly on the plate nick knew it was too hot he poured on some tomato catchup he knew the beans and spaghetti were still too hot he looked at the fire then at the tent he was not going to spoil it all by burning his tongue for years he had never enjoyed fried bananas because he had never been able to wait for them to cool his tongue was very sensitive he was very hungry across the river in the swamp in the almost dark he saw a mist rising he looked at the tent once more all right he took a full spoonful from the plate chrise nick said geezus chrise he said happily he ate the whole plateful before he remembered the bread nick finished the second plateful with the bread mopping the plate shiny he had not eaten since a cup of coffee and a ham sandwich in the station restaurant at st ignace it had been a very fine experience he had been that hungry before but had not been able to satisfy it he could have made camp hours before if he had wanted to there were plenty of good places to camp on the river but this was good nick tucked two big chips of pine under the grill the fire flared up he had forgotten to get water for the coffee out of the pack he got a folding canvas bucket and walked down the hill across the edge of the meadow to the stream the other bank was in the white mist the grass was wet and cold as he knelt on the bank and dipped the canvas bucket into the stream it bellied and pulled hard in the current the water was ice cold nick rinsed the bucket and carried it full up to the camp up away from the stream it was not so cold nick drove another big nail and hung up the bucket full of water he dipped the coffee pot half full put some more chips under the grill onto the fire and put the pot on he could not remember which way he made coffee he could remember an argument about it with hopkins but not which side he had taken he decided to bring it to a boil he remembered now that was hopkins s way he had once argued about everything with hopkins while he waited for the coffee to boil he opened a small can of apricots he liked to open cans he emptied the can of apricots out into a tin cup while he watched the coffee on the fire he drank the juice syrup of the apricots carefully at first to keep from spilling then meditatively sucking the apricots down they were better than fresh apricots the coffee boiled as he watched the lid came up and coffee and grounds ran down the side of the pot nick took it off the grill it was a triumph for hopkins he put sugar in the empty apricot cup and poured some of the coffee out to cool it was too hot to pour and he used his hat to hold the handle of the coffee pot he would not let it steep in the pot at all not the first cup it should be straight hopkins all the way hop deserved that he was a very serious coffee drinker he was the most serious man nick had ever known not heavy serious that was a long time ago hopkins spoke without moving his lips he had played polo he made millions of dollars in texas he had borrowed carfare to go to chicago when the wire came that his first big well had come in he could have wired for money that would have been too slow they called hop s girl the blonde venus hop did not mind because she was not his real girl hopkins said very confidently that none of them would make fun of his real girl he was right hopkins went away when the telegram came that was on the black river it took eight days for the telegram to reach him hopkins gave away his 22 caliber colt automatic pistol to nick he gave his camera to bill it was to remember him always by they were all going fishing again next summer the hop head was rich he would get a yacht and they would all cruise along the north shore of lake superior he was excited but serious they said good bye and all felt bad it broke up the trip they never saw hopkins again that was a long time ago on the black river nick drank the coffee the coffee according to hopkins the coffee was bitter nick laughed it made a good ending to the story his mind was starting to work he knew he could choke it because he was tired enough he spilled the coffee out of the pot and shook the grounds loose into the fire he lit a cigarette and went inside the tent he took off his shoes and trousers sitting on the blankets rolled the shoes up inside the trousers for a pillow and got in between the blankets out through the front of the tent he watched the glow of the fire when the night wind blew on it it was a quiet night the swamp was perfectly quiet nick stretched under the blanket comfortably a mosquito hummed close to his ear nick sat up and lit a match the mosquito was on the canvas over his head nick moved the match quickly up to it the mosquito made a satisfactory hiss in the flame the match went out nick lay down again under the blanket he turned on his side and shut his eyes he was sleepy he felt sleep coming he curled up under the blanket and went to sleep chapter xv they hanged sam cardinella at six o clock in the morning in the corridor of the county jail the corridor was high and narrow with tiers of cells on either side all the cells were occupied the men had been brought in for the hanging five men sentenced to be hanged were in the five top cells three of the men to be hanged were negroes they were very frightened one of the white men sat on his cot with his head in his hands the other lay flat on his cot with a blanket wrapped around his head they came out onto the gallows through a door in the wall there were seven of them including two priests they were carrying sam cardinella he had been like that since about four o clock in the morning while they were strapping his legs together two guards held him up and the two priests were whispering to him be a man my son said one priest when they came toward him with the cap to go over his head sam cardinella lost control of his sphincter muscle the guards who had been holding him up both dropped him they were both disgusted how about a chair will asked one of the guards better get one said a man in a derby hat when they all stepped back on the scaf olding back of the drop which was very heavy built of oak and steel and swung on ball bearings sam cardinella was left sitting there strapped tight the younger of the two priests kneeling beside the chair the priest skipped back onto the scaf olding just before the drop fell big two hearted river part ii in the morning the sun was up and the tent was starting to get hot nick crawled out under the mosquito netting stretched across the mouth of the tent to look at the morning the grass was wet on his hands as he came out he held his trousers and his shoes in his hands the sun was just up over the hill there was the meadow the river and the swamp there were birch trees in the green of the swamp on the other side of the river the river was clear and smoothly fast in the early morning down about two hundred yards were three logs all the way across the stream they made the water smooth and deep above them as nick watched a mink crossed the river on the logs and went into the swamp nick was excited he was excited by the early morning and the river he was really too hurried to eat breakfast but he knew he must he built a little fire and put on the coffee pot while the water was heating in the pot he took an empty bottle and went down over the edge of the high ground to the meadow the meadow was wet with dew and nick wanted to catch grasshoppers for bait before the sun dried the grass he found plenty of good grasshoppers they were at the base of the grass stems sometimes they clung to a grass stem they were cold and wet with the dew and could not jump until the sun warmed them nick picked them up taking only the medium sized brown ones and put them into the bottle he turned over a log and just under the shelter of the edge were several hundred hoppers it was a grasshopper lodging house nick put about fifty of the medium browns into the bottle while he was picking up the hoppers the others warmed in the sun and commenced to hop away they flew when they hopped at first they made one flight and stayed stiff when they landed as though they were dead nick knew that by the time he was through with breakfast they would be as lively as ever without dew in the grass it would take him all day to catch a bottle full of good grasshoppers and he would have to crush many of them slamming at them with his hat he washed his hands at the stream he was excited to be near it then he walked up to the tent the hoppers were already jumping stiffly in the grass in the bottle warmed by the sun they were jumping in a mass nick put in a pine stick as a cork it plugged the mouth of the bottle enough so the hoppers could not get out and left plenty of air passage he had rolled the log back and knew he could get grasshoppers there every morning nick laid the bottle full of jumping grasshoppers against a pine trunk rapidly he mixed some buckwheat flour with water and stirred it smooth one cup of flour one cup of water he put a handful of coffee in the pot and dipped a lump of grease out of a can and slid it sputtering across the hot skillet on the smoking skillet he poured smoothly the buckwheat batter it spread like lava the grease spitting sharply around the edges the buckwheat cake began to firm then brown then crisp the surface was bubbling slowly to porousness nick pushed under the browned under surface with a fresh pine chip he shook the skillet sideways and the cake was loose on the surface i won t try and flop it he thought he slid the chip of clean wood all the way under the cake and flopped it over onto its face it sputtered in the pan when it was cooked nick regreased the skillet he used all the batter it made another big flapjack and one smaller one nick ate a big flapjack and a smaller one covered with apple butter he put apple butter on the third cake folded it over twice wrapped it in oiled paper and put it in his shirt pocket he put the apple butter jar back in the pack and cut bread for two sandwiches in the pack he found a big onion he sliced it in two and peeled the silky outer skin then he cut one half into slices and made onion sandwiches he wrapped them in oiled paper and buttoned them in the other pocket of his khaki shirt he turned the skillet upside down on the grill drank the coffee sweetened and yellow brown with the condensed milk in it and tidied up the camp it was a good camp nick took his fly rod out of the leather rod case jointed it and shoved the rod case back into the tent he put on the reel and threaded the line through the guides he had to hold it from hand to hand as he threaded it or it would slip back through its own weight it was a heavy double tapered fly line nick had paid eight dollars for it a long time ago it was made heavy to lift back in the air and come forward flat and heavy and straight to make it possible to cast a fly which has no weight nick opened the aluminum leader box the leaders were coiled between the damp flannel pads nick had wet the pads at the water cooler on the train up to st ignace in the damp pads the gut leaders had softened and nick unrolled one and tied it by a loop at the end to the heavy fly line he fastened a hook on the end of the leader it was a small hook very thin and springy nick took it from his hook book sitting with the rod across his lap he tested the knot and the spring of the rod by pulling the line taut it was a good feeling he was careful not to let the hook bite into his finger he started down to the stream holding his rod the bottle of grasshoppers hung from his neck by a thong tied in half hitches around the neck of the bottle his landing net hung by a hook from his belt over his shoulder was a long flour sack tied at each corner into an ear the cord went over his shoulder the sack flapped against his legs nick felt awkward and professionally happy with all his equipment hanging from him the grasshopper bottle swung against his chest in his shirt the breast pockets bulged against him with the lunch and his fly book he stepped into the stream it was a shock his trousers clung tight to his legs his shoes felt the gravel the water was a rising cold shock rushing the current sucked against his legs where he stepped in the water was over his knees he waded with the current the gravel slid under his shoes he looked down at the swirl of water below each leg and tipped up the bottle to get a grasshopper the first grasshopper gave a jump in the neck of the bottle and went out into the water he was sucked under in the whirl by nick s right leg and came to the surface a little way down stream he floated rapidly kicking in a quick circle breaking the smooth surface of the water he disappeared a trout had taken him another hopper poked his face out of the bottle his antennæ wavered he was getting his front legs out of the bottle to jump nick took him by the head and held him while he threaded the slim hook under his chin down through his thorax and into the last segments of his abdomen the grasshopper took hold of the hook with his front feel spitting tobacco juice on it nick dropped him into the water holding the rod in his right hand he let out line against the pull of the grasshopper in the current he stripped off line from the reel with his left hand and let it run free he could see the hopper in the little waves of the current it went out of sight there was a tug on the line nick pulled against the taut line it was his first strike holding the now living rod across the current he brought in the line with his left hand the rod bent in jerks the trout pumping against the current nick knew it was a small one he lifted the rod straight up in the air it bowed with the pull he saw the trout in the water jerking with his head and body against the shifting tangent of the line in the stream nick took the line in his left hand and pulled the trout thumping tiredly against the current to the surface his back was mottled the clear water over gravel color his side flashing in the sun the rod under his right arm nick stooped dipping his right hand into the current he held the trout never still with his moist right hand while he unhooked the barb from his mouth then dropped him back into the stream he hung unsteadily in the current then settled to the bottom beside a stone nick reached down his hand to touch him his arm to the elbow under water the trout was steady in the moving stream resting on the gravel beside a stone as nick s fingers touched him touched his smooth cool underwater feeling he was gone gone in a shadow across the bottom of the stream he s all right nick thought he was only tired he had wet his hand before he touched the trout so he would not disturb the delicate mucus that covered him if a trout was touched with a dry hand a white fungus attacked the unprotected spot years before when he had fished crowded streams with fly fishermen ahead of him and behind him nick had again and again come on dead trout furry with white fungus drifted against a rock or floating belly up in some pool nick did not like to fish with other men on the river unless they were of your party they spoiled it he wallowed down the stream above his knees in the current through the fifty yards of shallow water above the pile of logs that crossed the stream he did not rebait his hook and held it in his hand as he waded he was certain he could catch small trout in the shallows but he did not want them there would be no big trout in the shallows this time of day now the water deepened up his thighs sharply and coldly ahead was the smooth dammed back flood of water above the logs the water was smooth and dark on the left the lower edge of the meadow on the right the swamp nick leaned back against the current and took a hopper from the bottle he threaded the hopper on the hook and spat on him for good luck then he pulled several yards of line from the reel and tossed the hopper out ahead onto the fast dark water it floated down towards the logs then the weight of the line pulled the bait under the surface nick held the rod in his right hand letting the line run out through his fingers there was a long tug nick struck and the rod came alive and dangerous bent double the line tightening coming out of water tightening all in a heavy dangerous steady pull nick felt the moment when the leader would break if the strain increased and let the line go the reel ratcheted into a mechanical shriek as the line went out in a rush too fast nick could not check it the line rushing out the reel note rising as the line ran out with the core of the reel showing his heart feeling stopped with the excitement leaning back against the current that mounted icily his thighs nick thumbed the reel hard with his left hand it was awkward getting his thumb inside the fly reel frame as he put on pressure the line tightened into sudden hardness and beyond the logs a huge trout went high out of water as he jumped nick lowered the tip of the rod but he felt as he dropped the tip to ease the strain the moment when the strain was too great the hardness too tight of course the leader had broken there was no mistaking the feeling when all spring left the line and it became dry and hard then it went slack his mouth dry his heart down nick reeled in he had never seen so big a trout there was a heaviness a power not to be held and then the bulk of him as he jumped he looked as broad as a salmon nick s hand was shaky he reeled in slowly the thrill had been too much he felt vaguely a little sick as though it would be better to sit down the leader had broken where the hook was tied to it nick took it in his hand he thought of the trout somewhere on the bottom holding himself steady over the gravel far down below the light under the logs with the hook in his jaw nick knew the trout s teeth would cut through the snell of the hook the hook would imbed itself in his jaw he d bet the trout was angry anything that size would be angry that was a trout he had been solidly hooked solid as a rock he felt like a rock too before he started off by god he was a big one by god he was the biggest one i ever heard of nick climbed out onto the meadow and stood water running down his trousers and out of his shoes his shoes squelchy he went over and sat on the logs he did not want to rush his sensations any he wriggled his toes in the water in his shoes and got out a cigarette from his breast pocket he lit it and tossed the match into the fast water below the logs a tiny trout rose at the match as it swung around in the fast current nick laughed he would finish the cigarette he sat on the logs smoking drying in the sun the sun warm on his back the river shallow ahead entering the woods curving into the woods shallows light glittering big water smooth rocks cedars along the bank and white birches the logs warm in the sun smooth to sit on without bark gray to the touch slowly the feeling of disappointment left him it went away slowly the feeling of disappointment that came sharply after the thrill that made his shoulders ache it was all right now his rod lying out on the logs nick tied a new hook on the leader pulling the gut tight until it grimped into itself in a hard knot he baited up then picked up the rod and walked to the far end of the logs to get into the water where it was not too deep under and beyond the logs was a deep pool nick walked around the shallow shelf near the swamp shore until he came out on the shallow bed of the stream on the left where the meadow ended and the woods began a great elm tree was uprooted gone over in a storm it lay back into the woods its roots clotted with dirt grass growing in them rising a solid bank beside the stream the river cut to the edge of the uprooted tree from where nick stood he could see deep channels like ruts cut in the shallow bed of the stream by the flow of the current pebbly where he stood and pebbly and full of boulders beyond where it curved near the tree roots the bed of the stream was marly and between the ruts of deep water green weed fronds swung in the current nick swung the rod back over his shoulder and forward and the line curving forward laid the grasshopper down on one of the deep channels in the weeds a trout struck and nick hooked him holding the rod far out toward the uprooted tree and sloshing backward in the current nick worked the trout plunging the rod bending alive out of the danger of the weeds into the open river holding the rod pumping alive against the current nick brought the trout in he rushed but always came the spring of the rod yielding to the rushes sometimes jerking under water but always bringing him in nick eased downstream with the rushes the rod above his head he led the trout over the net then lifted the trout hung heavy in the net mottled trout back and silver sides in the meshes nick unhooked him heavy sides good to hold big undershot jaw and slipped him heaving and big sliding into the long sack that hung from his shoulders in the water nick spread the mouth of the sack against the current and it filled heavy with water he held it up the bottom in the stream and the water poured out through the sides inside at the bottom was the big trout alive in the water nick moved downstream the sack out ahead of him sunk heavy in the water pulling from his shoulders it was getting hot the sun hot on the back of his neck nick had one good trout he did not care about getting many trout now the stream was shallow and wide there were trees along both banks the trees of the left bank made short shadows on the current in the forenoon sun nick knew there were trout in each shadow in the afternoon after the sun had crossed toward the hills the trout would be in the cool shadows on the other side of the stream the very biggest ones would lie up close to the bank you could always pick them up there on the black when the sun was down they all moved out into the current just when the sun made the water blinding in the glare before it went down you were liable to strike a big trout anywhere in the current it was almost impossible to fish then the surface of the water was blinding as a mirror in the sun of course you could fish upstream but in a stream like the black or this you had to wallow against the current and in a deep place the water piled up on you it was no fun to fish upstream with this much current nick moved along through the shallow stretch watching the banks for deep holes a beech tree grew close beside the river so that the branches hung down into the water the stream went back in under the leaves there were always trout in a place like that nick did not care about fishing that hole he was sure he would get hooked in the branches it looked deep though he dropped the grasshopper so the current took it under water back in under the overhanging branch the line pulled hard and nick struck the trout threshed heavily half out of water in the leaves and branches the line was caught nick pulled hard and the trout was off he reeled in and holding the hook in his hand walked down the stream ahead close to the left bank was a big log nick saw it was hollow pointing up river the current entered it smoothly only a little ripple spread each side of the log the water was deepening the top of the hollow log was gray and dry it was partly in the shadow nick took the cork out of the grasshopper bottle and a hopper clung to it he picked him off hooked him and tossed him out he held the rod far out so that the hopper on the water moved into the current flowing into the hollow log nick lowered the rod and the hopper floated in there was a heavy strike nick swung the rod against the pull it felt as though he were hooked into the log itself except for the live feeling he tried to force the fish out into the current it came heavily the line went slack and nick thought the trout was gone then he saw him very near in the current shaking his head trying to get the hook out his mouth was clamped shut he was fighting the hook in the clear flowing current looping in the line with his left hand nick swung the rod to make the line taut and tried to lead the trout toward the net but he was gone out of sight the line pumping nick fought him against the current letting him thump in the water against the spring of the rod he shifted the rod to his left hand worked the trout upstream holding his weight fighting on the rod and then let him down into the net he lifted him clear of the water a heavy half circle in the net the net dripping unhooked him and slid him into the sack he spread the mouth of the sack and looked down in at the two big trout alive in the water through the deepening water nick waded over to the hollow log he took the sack off over his head the trout flopping as it came out of water and hung it so the trout were deep in the water then he pulled himself up on the log and sat the water from his trouser and boots running down into the stream he laid his rod down moved along to the shady end of the log and took the sandwiches out of his pocket he dipped the sandwiches in the cold water the current carried away the crumbs he ate the sandwiches and dipped his hat full of water to drink the water running out through his hat just ahead of his drinking it was cool in the shade sitting on the log he took a cigarette out and struck a match to light it the match sunk into the gray wood making a tiny furrow nick leaned over the side of the log found a hard place and lit the match he sat smoking and watching the river ahead the river narrowed and went into a swamp the river became smooth and deep and the swamp looked solid with cedar trees their trunks close together their branches solid it would not be possible to walk through a swamp like that the branches grew so low you would have to keep almost level with the ground to move at all you could not crash through the branches that must be why the animals that lived in swamps were built the way they were nick thought he wished he had brought something to read he felt like reading he did not feel like going on into the swamp he looked down the river a big cedar slanted all the way across the stream beyond that the river went into the swamp nick did not want to go in there now he felt a reaction against deep wading with the water deepening up under his armpits to hook big trout in places impossible to land them in the swamp the banks were bare the big cedars came together overhead the sun did not come through except in patches in the fast deep water in the half light the fishing would be tragic in the swamp fishing was a tragic adventure nick did not want it he did not want to go down the stream any further today he took out his knife opened it and stuck it in the log then he pulled up the sack reached into it and brought out one of the trout holding him near the tail hard to hold alive in his hand he whacked him against the log the trout quivered rigid nick laid him on the log in the shade and broke the neck of the other fish the same way he laid them side by side on the log they were fine trout nick cleaned them slitting them from the vent to the tip of the jaw all the insides and the gills and tongue came out in one piece they were both males long gray white strips of milt smooth and clean all the insides clean and compact coming out all together nick tossed the offal ashore for the minks to find he washed the trout in the stream when he held them back up in the water they looked like live fish their color was not gone yet he washed his hands and dried them on the log then he laid the trout on the sack spread out on the log rolled them up in it tied the bundle and put it in the landing net his knife was still standing blade stuck in the log he cleaned it on the wood and put it in his pocket nick stood up on the log holding his rod the landing net hanging heavy then stepped into the water and splashed ashore he climbed the bank and cut up into the woods toward the high ground he was going back to camp he looked back the river just showed through the trees there were plenty of days coming when he could fish the swamp l envoi the king was working in the garden he seemed very glad to see me we walked through the garden this is the queen he said she was clipping a rose bush oh how do you do she said we sat down at a table under a big tree and the king ordered whiskey and soda we have good whiskey anyway he said the revolutionary committee he told me would not allow him to go outside the palace grounds plastiras is a very good man i believe he said but frightfully dif icult i think he did right though shooting those chaps if kerensky had shot a few men things might have

undefeated manuel garcia climbed the stairs to don miguel retana s office he set down his suitcase and knocked on the door there was no answer manuel standing in the hallway felt there was someone in

manolo manuel said what do you want asked the voice i want to work manuel said something in the door clicked several times and it swung open manuel went in carrying his suitcase a little man sat behind a desk at the far side of the room over his head was a bull s head stuffed by a madrid taxidermist on the walls were framed photographs and bull fight posters the little man sat looking at manuel i thought they d killed you he said manuel knocked with his knuckles on the desk the little man sat looking at him across the desk how many corridas you had this year retana asked one he answered just that one the little man asked that s all i read about it in the papers retana said he leaned back in the chair and looked at manuel manuel looked up at the stuffed bull he had seen it often before he felt a certain family interest in it it had killed his brother the promising one about nine years ago manuel remembered the day there was a brass plate on the oak shield the bull s head was mounted on manuel could not read it but he imagined it was in memory of his brother well he had been a good kid the plate said the bull mariposa of the duke of veragua which accepted 9 varas for 7 caballos and caused the death of antonio garcia novillero april 27 1909 retana saw him looking at the stuffed bull s head the lot the duke sent me for sunday will make a scandal he said they re all bad in the legs what do they say about them at the café i don t know manuel said i just got in yes retana said you still have your bag he looked at manuel leaning back behind the big desk sit down

don t look well retana said i just got out of the hospital manuel said i heard they d cut your leg off retana said no said manuel it got all right retana leaned forward across the desk and pushed a wooden box of cigarettes toward manuel have a cigarette he said thanks manuel lit it smoke he said offering the match to retana no retana waved his hand i never smoke retana watched him smoking why don t you get a job and go to work he said i don t want to work manuel said i am a bullfighter there aren t any bullfighters any more retana said i m a bullfighter manuel said yes while you re in

manuel asked i don t know whatever stuff they ve got in the corrals what the veterinaries won t pass in the daytime i don t like to substitute manuel said you can take it or leave it retana said he leaned forward over the papers he was no longer interested the appeal that manuel had made to him for a moment when he thought of the old days was gone he would like to get him to substitute for larita because he could get him cheaply he could get others cheaply too he would like to help him though still he had given him the chance it was up to him how much do i get manuel asked he was still playing with the idea of refusing but he knew he could not refuse two hundred and fifty pesetas retana said he had thought of five hundred but when he opened his mouth it said two hundred and fifty you pay villalta seven thousand manuel said you re not villalta retana said i know it manuel said he draws it manolo retana said in explanation sure said manuel he stood up give me three hundred retana all right retana agreed he reached in the drawer for a paper can i have fifty now manuel asked sure said retana he took a fifty peseta note out of his pocket book and laid it spread out flat on

they re not much retana admitted i ve got to have one good pic manuel said get him then retana said go and get him not out of this manuel said i m not paying for any cuadrilla out of sixty duros retana said nothing but looked at manuel across the big desk you know i ve got to have one good pic manuel said retana said nothing but looked at manuel from a long way off it isn t right manuel said retana was still considering him leaning back in his chair considering him from a long way away there re the regular pics he offered i know manuel said i know your regular pics retana did not smile manuel knew it was over all i want is an even break manuel said reasoningly when i go out there i want to be able to call my shots on the bull it only takes one good picador he was talking to a man who was no longer listening if you want something extra retana said go and get it there will be a regular cuadrilla out there bring as many of your own pics as you want the charlotada is over by 10 30 all right manuel said if that s the way you feel about it that s the way retana said i ll see you tomorrow night manuel said i ll be out there retana said manuel picked up his suitcase and went out shut the door retana called manuel looked back retana was sitting forward looking at some papers manuel pulled the door tight until it clicked he went down the stairs and out of the door into the hot brightness of the street it was very hot in the street and the light on the white buildings was sudden and hard on his eyes he walked down the shady side of the steep street toward the puerta del sol the shade felt solid and cool as running water the heat came suddenly as he crossed the intersecting streets manuel saw no one he knew in all the people he passed just before the puerta del sol he turned into a café it was quiet in the café there were a few men sitting at tables against the wall at one table four men played cards most of the men sat against the wall smoking empty coffee cups and liqueurglasses before them on the tables manuel went through the long room to a small room in back a man sat at a table in the corner asleep manuel sat down at one of the tables a waiter came in and stood beside manuel s table have you seen zurito manuel asked him he was in before lunch the waiter answered he won t be back before five o clock bring me some coffee and milk and a shot of the ordinary manuel said the waiter came back into the room carrying a tray with a big coffee glass and a liqueur glass on it in his left hand he held a bottle of brandy he swung these down to the table and a boy who had followed him poured coffee and milk into the glass from two shiny spouted pots with long handles manuel took off his cap and the waiter noticed his pigtail pinned forward on his head he winked at the coffee boy as he poured out the brandy into the little glass beside manuel s coffee the coffee boy looked at manuel s pale face curiously you fighting here asked the waiter corking up the bottle yes manuel said tomorrow the waiter stood there holding the bottle on one hip you in the charlie chaplins he asked the coffee boy looked away embarrassed no in the ordinary i thought they were going to have chaves and hernandez the waiter said no me and another who chaves or hernandez hernandez i think what s the matter with chaves he got hurt where did you hear that retana hey looie the waiter called to the next room chaves got cogida manuel had taken the wrapper off the lumps of sugar and dropped them into his coffee he stirred it and drank it down sweet hot and warming in his empty stomach he drank off the brandy give me another shot of that he said to the waiter the waiter uncorked the bottle and poured the glass full slopping another drink into the saucer another waiter had come up in front of the table the coffee boy was gone is chaves hurt bad the second waiter asked manuel i don t know manuel said retana didn t say a hell of a lot he cares the tall waiter said manuel had not seen him before he must have just come up if you stand in with retana in this town you re a made man the tall waiter said if you aren t in with him you might just as well go out and shoot yourself you said it the other waiter who had come in said you said it then you re right i said it said the tall waiter i know what i m talking about when i talk about that bird look what he s done for villalta the first waiter said and that ain t all the tall waiter said look what he s done for marcial lalanda look what he s done for nacional you said it kid agreed the short waiter manuel looked at them standing talking in front of his table he had drunk his second brandy they had forgotten about him they were not interested in him look at that bunch of camels the tall waiter went on did you ever see this nacional ii i seen him last sunday didn t i the original waiter said he s a giraffe the short waiter said what did i tell you the tall waiter said those are retana s boys say give me another shot of that manuel said he had poured the brandy the waiter had slopped over in the saucer into his glass and drank it while they were talking the original waiter poured his glass full mechanically and the three of them went out of the room talking in the far corner the man was still asleep snoring slightly on the intaking breath his head back against the wall manuel drank his brandy he felt sleepy himself it was too hot to go out into the town besides there was nothing to do he wanted to see zurito he would go to sleep while he waited he kicked his suitcase under the table to be sure it was there perhaps it would be better to put it back under the seat against the wall he leaned down and shoved it under then he leaned forward on the table and went to sleep when he woke there was someone sitting across the table from him it was a big man with a heavy brown face like an indian he had been sitting there some time he had waved the waiter away and sat reading the paper and occasionally looking down at manuel asleep his head on the table he read the paper laboriously forming the words with his lips as he read when it tired him he looked at manuel he sat heavily in the chair his black cordoba hat tipped forward manuel sat up and looked at him hello zurito he said hello kid the big man said i ve been asleep manuel rubbed his forehead with the back of his fist i thought maybe you were how s everything good how is everything with you not so good they were both silent zurito the picador looked at manuel s white face manuel looked down at the picador s enormous hands folding the paper to put away in his pocket i got a favor to ask you manos manuel said manosduros was zurito s nickname he never heard it without thinking of his huge hands he put them forward on the table self consciously let s have a drink he said sure said manuel the waiter came and went and came again he went out of the room looking back at the two men at the table what s the matter manolo zurito set down his glass would you pic two bulls for me tomorrow night manuel asked looking up at zurito across the table no said zurito i m not pic ing manuel looked down at his glass he had expected that answer now he had it well he had it i m sorry manolo but i m not pic ing zurito looked at his hands that s all right manuel said i m too old zurito said i just asked you manuel said is

zurito come on up to the house manuel reached under the seat for his suitcase he was happy he knew zurito would pic for him he was the best picador living it was all simple now come on up to the house and we ll eat zurito said manuel stood in the patio de caballos waiting for the charlie chaplins to be over zurito stood beside him where they stood it was dark the high door that led into the bull ring was shut above them they heard a shout then another shout of laughter then there was silence manuel liked the smell of the stables about the patio de caballos it smelt good in the dark there was another roar from the arena and then applause prolonged applause going on and on you ever seen these fellows zurito asked big and looming beside manuel in the dark no manuel said they re pretty funny zurito said he smiled to himself in the dark the high double tight fitting door into the bull ring swung open and manuel saw the ring in the hard light of the arc lights the plaza dark all the way around rising high around the edge of the ring were running and bowing two men dressed like tramps followed by a third in the uniform of a hotel bell boy who stooped and picked up the hats and canes thrown down onto the sand and tossed them back up into the darkness the electric light went on in the patio i ll climb onto one of those ponies while you collect the kids zurito said behind them came the jingle of the mules coming out to go into the arena and be hitched onto the dead bull the members of the cuadrilla who had been watching the burlesque from the runway between the barrera and the seals came walking back and stood in a group talking under the electric light in the patio a good looking lad in a silver and orange suit came up to manuel and smiled i m hernandez he said and put out his hand manuel shook it they re regular elephants we ve got tonight the boy said cheerfully they re big ones with horns manuel agreed you drew the worst lot the boy said that s all right manuel said the bigger they are the more meat for the poor where did you get that one hernandez grinned that s an old one manuel said you line up your cuadrilla so i can see what i ve got you ve got some good kids hernandez said he was very cheerful he had been on twice before in nocturnals and was beginning to get a following in madrid he was happy the fight would start in a few minutes where are the pics manuel asked they re back in the corrals fighting about who gets the beautiful horses hernandez grinned the mules came through the gate in a rush the whips snapping bells jangling and the young bull ploughing a furrow of sand they formed up for the paseo as soon as the bull had gone through manuel and hernandez stood in front the youths of the cuadrillas were behind their heavy capes furled over their arms in back the four picadors mounted holding their steel tipped pushpoles erect in the half dark of the corral it s a wonder retana wouldn t give us enough light to see the horses by one picador said he knows we ll be happier if we don t get too good a look at these skins another pic answered this thing i m on barely keeps me off the ground the first picador said well they re horses sure they re horses they talked sitting their gaunt horses in the dark zurito said nothing he had the only steady horse of the lot he had tried him wheeling him in the corrals and he responded to the bit and the spurs he had taken the bandage off his right eye and cut the strings where they had tied his ears tight shut at the base he was a good solid horse solid on his legs that was all he needed he intended to ride him all through the corrida he had already since he had mounted sitting in the half dark in the big quilted saddle waiting for the paseo pic ed through the whole corrida in his mind the other picadors went on talking on both sides of him he did not hear them the two matadors stood together in front of their three peones their capes furled over their left arms in the same fashion manuel was thinking about the three lads in back of him they were all three madrileños like hernandez boys about nineteen one of them a gypsy serious aloof and dark faced he liked the look of he turned what s your name kid he asked the gypsy fuentes the gypsy said that s a good name manuel said the gypsy smiled showing his teeth you take the bull and give him a little run when he comes out manuel said all right the gypsy said his face was serious he began to think about just what he would do here she goes manuel said to hernandez all right we ll go heads up swinging with the music their right arms swinging free they stepped out crossing the sanded arena under the arc lights the cuadrillas opening out behind the picadors riding after behind came the bull ring servants and the jingling mules the crowd applauded hernandez as they marched across the arena arrogant swinging they looked straight ahead as they marched they bowed before the president and the procession broke up into its component parts the bull fighters went over to the barrera and changed their heavy mantles for the light fighting capes the mules went out the picadors galloped jerkily around the ring and two rode out the gate they had come in by the servants swept the sand smooth manuel drank a glass of water poured for him by one of retana s deputies who was acting as his manager and sword handler hernandez came over from speaking with his own manager you got a good hand kid manuel complimented him they like me hernandez said happily how did the paseo go manuel asked retana s man like a wedding said the handler fine you came out like joselito and belmonte zurito rode by a bulky equestrian statue he wheeled his horse and faced him toward the toril on the far side of the ring where the bull would come out it was strange under the arc light he pic ed in the hot afternoon sun for big money he didn t like this arc light business he wished they would get started manuel went up to him pic him manos he said cut him down to size for me i ll pic him kid zurito spat on the sand i ll make him jump out of the ring lean on him manos manuel said i ll lean on him zurito said what s holding it up he s coming now manuel said zurito sat there his feet in the box stirrups his great legs in the buckskin covered armor gripping the horse the reins in his left hand the long pic held in his right hand his broad hat well down over his eyes to shade them from the lights watching the distant door of the toril his horse s ears quivered zurito patted him with his left hand the red door of the toril swung back and for a moment zurito looked into the empty passageway far across the arena then the bull came out in a rush skidding on his four legs as he came out under the lights then charging in a gallop moving softly in a fast gallop silent except as he woofed through wide nostrils as he charged glad to be free after the dark pen in the first row of seats slightly bored leaning forward to write on the cement wall in front of his knees the substitute bull fight critic of el heraldo scribbled campagnero negro 42 came out at 90 miles an hour with plenty of gas manuel leaning against the barrera watching the bull waved his hand and the gypsy ran out trailing his cape the bull in full gallop pivoted and charged the cape his head down his tail rising the gypsy moved in a zigzag and as he passed the bull caught sight of him and abandoned the cape to charge the man the gyp sprinted and vaulted the red fence of the barrera as the bull struck it with his horns he tossed into it twice with his horns banging into the wood blindly the critic of el heraldo lit a cigarette and tossed the match at the bull then wrote in his notebook large and with enough horns to satisfy the cash customers campagnero showed a tendency to cut into the terrain of the bull fighters manuel stepped out on the hard sand as the bull banged into the fence out of the corner of his eye he saw zurito sitting the white horse close to the barrera about a quarter of the way around the ring to the left manuel held the cape close in front of him a fold in each hand and shouted at the bull huh huh the bull turned seemed to brace against the fence as he charged in a scramble driving into the cape as manuel side stepped pivoted on his heels with the charge of the bull and swung the cape just ahead of the horns at the end of the swing he was facing the bull again and held the cape in the same position close in front of his body and pivoted again as the bull recharged each time as he swung the crowd shouted four times he swung with the bull lifting the cape so it billowed full and each time bringing the bull around to charge again then at the end of the fifth swing he held the cape against his hip and pivoted so the cape swung out like a ballet dancer s skirt and wound the bull around himself like a belt to step clear leaving the bull facing zurito on the white horse come up and planted firm the horse facing the bull its ears forward its lips nervous zurito his hat over his eyes leaning forward the long pole sticking out before and behind in a sharp angle under his right arm held half way down the triangular iron point facing the bull el heraldo s second string critic drawing on his cigarette his eyes on the bull wrote the veteran manolo designed a series of acceptable verónicas ending in a very belmontistic recorte that earned applause from the regulars and we entered the tercio of the cavalry zurito sat his horse measuring the distance between the bull and the end of the pic as he looked the bull gathered himself together and charged his eyes on the horse s chest as he lowered his head to hook zurito sunk the point of the pic in the swelling hump of muscle above the bull s shoulder leaned all his weight on the shaft and with his left hand pulled the white horse into the air front hoofs pawing and swung him to the right as he pushed the bull under and through so the horns passed safely under the horse s belly and the horse came down quivering the bull s tail brushing his chest as he charged the cape hernandez offered him hernandez ran sideways taking the bull out and away with the cape toward the other picador he fixed him with a swing of the cape squarely facing the horse and rider and stepped back as the bull saw the horse he charged the picador s lance slid along his back and as the shock of the charge lifted the horse the picador was already half way out of the saddle lifting his right leg clear as he missed with the lance and falling to the left side to keep the horse between him and the bull the horse lifted and gored crashed over with the bull driving into him the picador gave a shove with his boots against the horse and lay clear waiting to be lifted and hauled away and put on his feet manuel let the bull drive into the fallen horse he was in no hurry the picador was safe besides it did a picador like that good to worry he d stay on longer next time lousy pics he looked across the sand at zurito a little way out from the barrera his horse rigid waiting huh he called to the bull tomar holding the cape in both hands so it would catch his eye the bull detached himself from the horse and charged the cape and manuel running sideways and holding the cape spread wide stopped swung on his heels and brought the bull sharply around facing zurito campagnero accepted a pair of varas for the death of one rosinante with hernandez and manolo at the quites el heraldo s critic wrote he pressed on the iron and clearly showed he was no horse lover the veteran zurito resurrected some of his old stuff with the pike pole notably the suerte olé olé the man sitting beside him shouted the shout was lost in the roar of the crowd and he slapped the critic on the back the critic looked up to see zurito directly below him leaning far out over his horse the length of the pic rising in a sharp angle under his armpit holding the pic almost by the point bearing down with all his weight holding the bull off the bull pushing and driving to get at the horse and zurito far out on top of him holding him holding him and slowly pivoting the horse against the pressure so that at last he was clear zurito felt the moment when the horse was clear and the bull could come past and relaxed the absolute steel lock of his resistance and the triangular steel point of the pic ripped in the bull s hump of shoulder muscle as he tore loose to find hernandez s cape before his muzzle he charged blindly into the cape and the boy took him out into the open arena zurito sat patting his horse and looking at the bull charging the cape that hernandez swung for him out under the bright light while the crowd shouted you see that one he said to manuel it was a wonder manuel said i got him that time zurito said look at him now at the conclusion of a closely turned pass of the cape the bull slid to his knees he was up at once but far out across the sand manuel and zurito saw the shine of the pumping flow of blood smooth against the black of the bull s shoulder i got him that time zurito said he s a good bull manuel said if they gave me another shot at him i d kill him zurito said they ll change the thirds on us manuel said look at him now zurito said i got to go over there manuel said and started on a run for the other side of the ring where the monos were leading a horse out by the bridle toward the bull whacking him on the legs with rods and all in a procession trying to get him toward the bull who stood dropping his head pawing unable to make up his mind to charge zurito sitting his horse walking him toward the scene not missing any detail scowled finally the bull charged the horse leaders ran for the barrera the picador hit too far back and the bull got under the horse lifted him threw him onto his back zurito watched the monos in their red shirts running out to drag the picador clear the picador now on his feet swearing and flopping his arms manuel and hernandez standing ready with their capes and the bull the great black bull with a horse on his back hooves dangling the bridle caught in the horns black bull with a horse on his back staggering short legged then arching his neck and lifting thrusting charging to slide the horse off horse sliding down then the bull into a lunging charge at the cape manuel spread for him the bull was slower now manuel felt he was bleeding badly there was a sheen of blood all down his flank manuel offered him the cape again there he came eyes open ugly watching the cape manuel stepped to the side and raised his arms tightening the cape ahead of the bull for the verónica now he was facing the bull yes his head was going down a little he was carrying it lower that was zurito manuel flopped the cape there he comes he side stepped and swung in another verónica he s shooting awfully accurately he thought he s had enough fight so he s watching now he s hunting now got his eye on me but i always give him the cape he shook the cape at the bull there he comes he side stepped awful close that time i don t want to work that close to him the edge of the cape was wet with blood where it had swept along the bull s back as he went by all right here s the last one manuel facing the bull having turned with him each charge offered the cape with his two hands the bull looked at him eyes watching horns straight forward the bull looked at him watching huh manuel said toro and leaning back swung the cape forward here he comes he side stepped swung the cape in back of him and pivoted so the bull followed a swirl of cape and then was left with nothing fixed by the pass dominated by the cape manuel swung the cape under his muzzle with one hand to show the bull was fixed and walked away there was no applause manuel walked across the sand toward the barrera while zurito rode out of the ring the trumpet had blown to change the act to the planting of the banderillas while manuel had been working with the bull he had not consciously noticed it the monos were spreading canvas over the two dead horses and sprinkling sawdust around them manuel came up to the barrera for a drink of water retana s man handed him the heavy porous jug fuentes the tall gypsy was standing holding a pair of banderillas holding them together slim red sticks fish hook points out he looked at manuel go on out there manuel said the gypsy trotted out manuel set down the jug and watched he wiped his face with his handkerchief the critic of el heraldo reached for the bottle of warm champagne that stood between his feet took a drink and finished his paragraph the aged manolo rated no applause for a vulgar series of lances with the cape and we entered the third of the palings alone in the center of the ring the bull stood still fixed fuentes tall flat backed walking toward him arrogantly his arms spread out the two slim red sticks one in each hand held by the fingers points straight forward fuentes walked forward back of him and to one side was a peon with a cape the bull looked at him and was no longer fixed his eyes watched fuentes now standing still now he leaned back calling to him fuentes twitched the two banderillas and the light on the steel points caught the bull s eye his tail went up and he charged he came straight his eyes on the man fuentes stood still leaning back the banderillas pointing forward as the bull lowered his head to hook fuentes leaned backward his arms came together and rose his two hands touching the banderillas two descending red lines and leaning forward drove the points into the bull s shoulder leaning far in over the bull s horns and pivoting on the two upright sticks his legs tight together his body curving to one side to let the bull pass olé from the crowd the bull was hooking wildly jumping like a trout all four feet off the ground the red shaft of the banderillas tossed as he jumped manuel standing at the barrera noticed that he looked always to the right tell him to drop the next pair on the right he said to the kid who started to run out to fuentes with the new banderillas a heavy hand fell on his shoulder it was zurito how do you feel kid he asked manuel was watching the bull zurito leaned forward on the barrera leaning the weight of his body on his arms manuel turned to him you re going good zurito said manuel shook his head he had nothing to do now until the next third the gypsy was very good with the banderillas the bull would come to him in the next third in good shape he was a good bull it had all been easy up to now the final stuff with the sword was all he worried over he did not really worry he did not even think about it but standing there he had a heavy sense of apprehension he looked out at the bull planning his faena his work with the red cloth that was to reduce the bull to make him manageable the gypsy was walking out toward the bull again walking heel and toe insultingly like a ballroom dancer the red shafts of the banderillas twitching with his walk the bull watched him not fixed now hunting him but waiting to get close enough so he could be sure of getting him getting the horns into him as fuentes walked forward the bull charged fuentes ran across the quarter of a circle as the bull charged and as he passed running backward stopped swung forward rose on his toes arms straight out and sunk the banderillas straight down into the tight of the big shoulder muscles as the bull missed him the crowd were wild about it that kid won t stay in this night stuff long retana s man said to zurito he s good zurito said watch him now they watched fuentes was standing with his back against the barrera two of the cuadrilla were back of him with their capes ready to flop over the fence to distract the bull the bull with his tongue out his barrel heaving was watching the gypsy he thought he had him now back against the red planks only a short charge away the bull watched him the gypsy bent back drew back his arms the banderillas pointing at the bull he called to the bull stamped one foot the bull was suspicious he wanted the man no more barbs in the shoulder fuentes walked a little closer to the bull bent back called again somebody in the crowd shouted a warning he s too damn close zurito said watch him retana s man said leaning back inciting the bull with the banderillas fuentes jumped both feet off the ground as he jumped the bull s tail rose and he charged fuentes came down on his toes arms straight out whole body arching forward and drove the shafts straight down as he swung his body clear of the right horn the bull crashed into the barrera where the flopping capes had attracted his eye as he lost the man the gypsy came running along the barrera toward manuel taking the applause of the crowd his vest was ripped where he had not quite cleared the point of the horn he was happy about it showing it to the spectators he made the tour of the ring zurito saw him go by smiling pointing at his vest he smiled somebody else was planting the last pair of banderillas nobody was paying any attention retana s man tucked a baton inside the red cloth of a muleta folded the cloth over it and handed it over the barrera to manuel he reached in the leather sword case took out a sword and holding it by its leather scabbard reached it over the fence to manuel manuel pulled the blade out by the red hilt and the scabbard fell limp he looked at zurito the big man saw he was sweating now you get him kid zurito said manuel nodded he s in good shape zurito said just like you want him retana s man assured him manuel nodded the trumpeter up under the roof blew for the final act and manuel walked across the arena toward where up in the dark boxes the president must be in the front row of seats the substitute bull fight critic of el heraldo took a long drink of the warm champagne he had decided it was not worth while to write a running story and would write up the corrida back in the office what the hell was it anyway only a nocturnal if he missed anything he would get it out of the morning papers he took another drink of the champagne he had a date at maxim s at twelve who were these bull fighters anyway kids and bums a bunch of bums he put his pad of paper in his pocket and looked over toward manuel standing very much alone in the ring gesturing with his hat in a salute toward a box he could not see high up in the dark plaza out in the ring the bull stood quiet looking at nothing i dedicate this bull to you mr president and to the public of madrid the most intelligent and generous of the world was what manuel was saying it was a formula he said it all it was a little long for nocturnal use he bowed at the dark straightened tossed his hat over his shoulder and carrying the muleta in his left hand and the sword in his right walked out toward the bull manuel walked toward the bull the bull looked at him his eyes were quick manuel noticed the way the banderillas hung down on his left shoulder and the steady sheen of blood from zurito s picing he noticed the way the bull s feet were as he walked forward holding the muleta in his left hand and the sword in his right he watched the bull s feet the bull could not charge without gathering his feet together now he stood square on them dully manuel walked toward him watching his feet this was all right he could do this he must work to get the bull s head down so he could go in past the horns and kill him he did not think about the sword not about killing the bull he thought about one thing at a time the coming things oppressed him though walking forward watching the bull s feet he saw successively his eyes his wet muzzle and the wide forward pointing spread of his horns the bull had light circles about his eyes his eyes watched manuel he felt he was going to get this little one with the white face standing still now and spreading the red cloth of the muleta with the sword pricking the point into the cloth so that the sword now held in his left hand spread the red flannel like the jib of a boat manuel noticed the points of the bull s horns one of them was splintered from banging against the barrera the other was sharp as a porcupine quill manuel noticed while spreading the muleta that the white base of the horn was stained red while he noticed these things he did not lose sight of the bull s feet the bull watched manuel steadily he s on the defensive now manuel thought he s reserving himself i ve got to bring him out of that and get his head down always get his head down zurito had his head down once but he s come back he ll bleed when i start him going and that will bring it down holding the muleta with the sword in his left hand widening it in front of him he called to the bull the bull looked at him he leaned back insultingly and shook the wide spread flannel the bull saw the muleta it was a bright scarlet under the arc light the bull s legs tightened here he comes whoosh manuel turned as the bull came and raised the muleta so that it passed over the bull s horns and swept down his broad back from head to tail the bull had gone clean up in the air with the charge manuel had not moved at the end of the pass the bull turned like a cat coming around a corner and faced manuel he was on the offensive again his heaviness was gone manuel noted the fresh blood shining down the black shoulder and dripping down the bull s leg he drew the sword out of the muleta and held it in his right hand the muleta held low down in his left hand leaning toward the left he called to the bull the bull s legs tightened his eyes on the muleta here he comes manuel thought yuh he swung with the charge sweeping the muleta ahead of the bull his feet firm the sword following the curve a point of light under the arcs the bull recharged as the pase natural finished and manuel raised the muleta for a pase de pecho firmly planted the bull came by his chest under the raised muleta manuel leaned his head back to avoid the clattering banderillo shafts the hot black bull body touched his chest as it passed too damn close manuel thought zurito leaning on the barrera spoke rapidly to the gypsy who trotted out toward manuel with a cape zurito pulled his hat down low and looked out across the arena at manuel manuel was facing the bull again the muleta held low and to the left the bull s head was down as he watched the muleta if it was belmonte doing that stuff they d go crazy retana s man said zurito said nothing he was watching manuel out in the center of the arena where did the boss dig this fellow up retana s man asked out of the hospital zurito said that s where he s going damn quick retana s man said zurito turned on him knock on that he said pointing to the barrera i was just kidding man retana s man said knock on the wood retana s man leaned forward and knocked three times on the barrera watch the faena zurito said out in the center of the ring under the lights manuel was kneeling facing the bull and as he raised the muleta in both hands the bull charged tail up manuel swung his body clear and as the bull recharged brought around the muleta in a halfcircle that pulled the bull to his knees why that one s a great bull fighter retana s man said no he s not said zurito manuel stood up and the muleta in his left hand the sword in his right acknowledged the applause from the dark plaza the bull had humped himself up from his knees and stood waiting his head hung low zurito spoke to two of the other lads of the cuadrilla and they ran out to stand back of manuel with their capes there were four men back of him now hernandez had followed him since he first came out with the muleta fuentes stood watching his cape held against his body tall in repose watching lazy eyed now the two came up hernandez motioned them to stand one at each side manuel stood alone facing the bull manuel waved back the men with the capes stepping back cautiously they saw his face was white and sweating didn t they know enough to keep back did they want to catch the bull s eye with the capes after he was fixed and ready he had enough to worry about without that kind of thing the bull was standing his four feet square looking at the muleta manuel furled the muleta in his left hand the bull s eyes watched it his body was heavy on his feel he carried his head low but not too low manuel lifted the muleta at him the bull did not move only his eyes watched he s all lead manuel thought he s all square he s framed right he ll take it he thought in bull fight terms sometimes he had a thought and the particular piece of slang would not come into his mind and he could not realize the thought his instincts and his knowledge worked automatically and his brain worked slowly and in words he knew all about bulls he did not have to think about them he just did the right thing his eyes noted things and his body performed the necessary measures without thought if he thought about it he would be gone now facing the bull he was conscious of many things at the same time there were the horns the one splintered the other smoothly sharp the need to profile himself toward the left horn lance himself short and straight lower the muleta so the bull would follow it and going in over the horns put the sword all the way into a little spot about as big as a five peseta piece straight in back of the neck between the sharp pitch of the bull s shoulders he must do all this and must then come out from between the horns he was conscious he must do all this but his only thought was in words corto y derecho corto y derecho he thought furling the muleta short and straight corto y derecho he drew the sword out of the muleta profiled on the splintered left horn dropped the muleta across his body so his right hand with the sword on the level with his eye made the sign of the cross and rising on his toes sighted along the dipping blade of the sword at the spot high up between the bull s shoulders corto y derecho he launched himself on the bull there was a shock and he felt himself go up in the air he pushed on the sword as he went up and over and it flew out of his hand he hit the ground and the bull was on him manuel lying on the ground kicked at the bull s muzzle with his slippered feet kicking kicking the bull after him missing him in his excitement bumping him with his head driving the horns into the sand kicking like a man keeping a ball in the air manuel kept the bull from getting a clean thrust at him manuel felt the wind on his back from the capes flopping at the bull and then the bull was gone gone over him in a rush dark as his belly went over not even stepped on manuel stood up and picked up the muleta fuentes handed him the sword it was bent where it had struck the shoulder blade manuel straightened it on his knee and ran toward the bull standing now beside one of the dead horses as he ran his jacket flopped where it had been ripped under his armpit get him out of there manuel shouted to the gypsy the bull had smelled the blood of the dead horse and ripped into the canvas cover with his horns he charged fuentes s cape with the canvas hanging from his splintered horn and the crowd laughed out in the ring he tossed his head to rid himself of the canvas hernandez running up from behind him grabbed the end of the canvas and neatly lifted it off the horn the bull followed it in a half charge and stopped still he was on the defensive again manuel was walking toward him with the sword and muleta manuel swung the muleta before him the bull would not charge manuel profiled toward the bull sighting along the dipping blade of the sword the bull was motionless seemingly dead on his feet incapable of another charge manuel rose to his toes sighting along the steel and charged again there was the shock and he felt himself being borne back in a rush to strike hard on the sand there was no chance of kicking this time the bull was on top of him manuel lay as though dead his head on his arms and the bull bumped him bumped his back bumped his face in the sand he felt the horn go into the sand between his folded arms the bull hit him in the small of the back his face drove into the sand the horn drove through one of his sleeves and the bull ripped it off manuel was tossed clear and the bull followed the capes manuel got up found the sword and muleta tried the point of the sword with his thumb and then ran toward the barrera for a new sword retana s man handed him the sword over the edge of the barrera wipe off your face he said manuel running again toward the bull wiped his bloody face with his handkerchief he had not seen zurito where was zurito the cuadrilla had stepped away from the bull and waited with their capes the bull stood heavy and dull again after the action manuel walked toward him with the muleta he stopped and shook it the bull did not respond he passed it right and left left and right before the bull s muzzle the bull s eyes watched it and turned with the swing but he would not charge he was waiting for manuel manuel was worried there was nothing to do but go in corto y derecho he profiled close to the bull crossed the muleta in front of his body and charged as he pushed in the sword he jerked his body to the left to clear the horn the bull passed him and the sword shot up in the air twinkling under the arc lights to fall red hilted on the sand manuel ran over and picked it up it was bent and he straightened it over his knee as he came running toward the bull fixed again now he passed hernandez standing with his cape he s all bone the boy said encouragingly manuel nodded wiping his face he put the bloody handkerchief in his pocket there was the bull he was close to the barrera now damn him maybe he was all bone maybe there was not any place for the sword to go in the hell there wasn t he d show them he tried a pass with the muleta and the bull did not move manuel chopped the muleta back and forth in front of the bull nothing doing he furled the muleta drew the sword out profiled and drove in on the bull he felt the sword buckle as he shoved it in leaning his weight on it and then it shot high in the air end over ending into the crowd manuel had jerked clear as the sword jumped the first cushions thrown down out of the dark missed him then one hit him in the face his bloody face looking toward the crowd they were coming down fast spotting the sand somebody threw an empty champagne bottle from close range it hit manuel on the foot he stood there watching the dark where the things were coming from then something whished through the air and struck by him manuel leaned over and picked it up it was his sword he straightened it over his knee and gestured with it to the crowd thank you he said thank you oh the dirty bastards dirty bastards oh the lousy dirty bastards he kicked into a cushion as he ran there was the bull the same as ever all right you dirty lousy bastard manuel passed the muleta in front of the bull s black muzzle nothing doing you won t all right he stepped close and jammed the sharp peak of the muleta into the bull s damp muzzle the bull was on him as he jumped back and as he tripped on a cushion he felt the horn go into him into his side he grabbed the horn with his two hands and rode backward holding tight onto the place the bull tossed him and he was clear he lay still it was all right the bull was gone he got up coughing and feeling broken and gone the dirty bastards give me the sword he shouted give me the stuff fuentes came up with the muleta and the sword hernandez put his arm around him go on to the infirmary man he said don t be a damn fool get away from me manuel said get to hell away from me he twisted free hernandez shrugged his shoulders manuel ran toward the bull there was the bull standing heavy firmly planted all right you bastard manuel drew the sword out of the muleta sighted with the same movement and flung himself onto the bull he felt the sword go in all the way right up to the guard four fingers and his thumb into the bull the blood was hot on his knuckles and he was on top of the bull the bull lurched with him as he lay on and seemed to sink then he was standing clear he looked at the bull going down slowly over on his side then suddenly four feet in the air then he gestured at the crowd his hand warm from the bull blood all right you bastards he wanted to say something but he started to cough it was hot and choking he looked down for the muleta he must go over and salute the president president hell he was sitting down looking at something it was the bull his four feet up thick tongue out things crawling around on his belly and under his legs crawling where the hair was thin dead bull to hell with the bull to hell with them all he started to get to his feet and commenced to cough he sat down again coughing somebody came and pushed him up they carried him across the ring to the infirmary running with him across the sand standing blocked at the gate as the mules came in then around under the dark passageway men grunting as they took him up the stairway and then laid him down the doctor and two men in white were waiting for him they laid him out on the table they were cutting away his shirt manuel felt tired his whole chest felt scalding inside he started to cough and they held something to his mouth everybody was very busy there was an electric light in his eyes he shut his eyes he heard someone coming very heavily up the stairs then he did not hear it then he heard a noise far off that was the crowd well somebody would have to kill his other bull they had cut away all his shirt the doctor smiled at him there was retana hello retana manuel said he could not hear his voice retana smiled at him and said something manuel could not hear it zurito stood beside the table bending over where the doctor was working he was in his picador clothes without his hat zurito said something to him manuel could not hear it zurito was speaking to retana one of the men in white smiled and handed retana a pair of scissors retana gave them to zurito zurito said something to manuel he could not hear it to hell with this operating table he d been on plenty of operating tables before he was not going to die there would be a priest if he was going to die zurito was saying something to him holding up the scissors that was it they were going to cut off his coleta they were going to cut off his pigtail manuel sat up on the operating table the doctor stepped back angry someone grabbed him and held him you couldn t do a thing like that manos he said he heard suddenly clearly zurito s voice that s all right zurito said i won t do it i was joking i was going good manuel said i didn t have any luck that was all manuel lay back they had put something over his face it was all familiar he inhaled deeply he felt very tired he was very very tired they took the thing away from his face i was going good manuel said weakly i was going great retana looked at zurito and started for the door i ll stay here with him zurito said retana shrugged his shoulders manuel opened his eyes and looked at zurito wasn t i going good manos he asked for confirmation sure said zurito you were going great the doctor s assistant put the cone over manuel s face and he inhaled deeply zurito stood awkwardly watching in another country in the fall the war was always there but we did not go to it any more it was cold in the fall in milan and the dark came very early then the electric lights came on and it was pleasant along the streets looking in the windows there was much game hanging outside the shops and the snow powdered in the fur of the foxes and the wind blew their tails the deer hung stiff and heavy and empty and small birds blew in the wind and the wind turned their feathers it was a cold fall and the wind came down from the mountains we were all at the hospital every afternoon and there were different ways of walking across the town through the dusk to the hospital two of the ways were alongside canals but they were long always though you crossed a bridge across a canal to enter the hospital there was a choice of three bridges on one of them a woman sold roasted chestnuts it was warm standing in front of her charcoal fire and the chestnuts were warm afterward in your pocket the hospital was very old and very beautiful and you entered through a gate and walked across a courtyard and out a gate on the other side there were usually funerals starting from the courtyard beyond the old hospital were the new brick pavilions and there we met every afternoon and were all very polite and interested in what was the matter and sat in the machines that were to make so much difference the doctor came up to the machine where i was sitting and said what did you like best to do before the war did you practice a sport i said yes football good he said you will be able to play football again better than ever my knee did not bend and the leg dropped straight from the knee to the ankle without a calf and the machine was to bend the knee and make it move as in riding a tricycle but it did not bend yet and instead the machine lurched when it came to the bending part the doctor said that will all pass you are a fortunate young man you will play football again like a champion in the next machine was a major who had a little hand like a baby s he winked at me when the doctor examined his hand which was between two leather straps that bounced up and down and flapped the stiff fingers and said and will i too play football captain doctor he had been a very great fencer and before the war the greatest fencer in italy the doctor went to his office in a back room and brought a photograph which showed a hand that had been withered almost as small as the major s before it had taken a machine course and after was a little larger the major held the photograph with his good hand and looked at it very carefully a wound he asked an industrial accident the doctor said very interesting very interesting the major said and handed it back to the doctor you have confidence no said the major there were three boys who came each day who were about the same age i was they were all three from milan and one of them was to be a lawyer and one was to be a painter and one had intended to be a soldier and after we were finished with the machines sometimes we walked back together to the café cova which was next door to the scala we walked the short way through the communist quarter because we were four together the people hated us because we were officers and from a wine shop some one would call out a basso gli uf iciali as we passed another boy who walked with us sometimes and made us five wore a black silk handkerchief across his face because he had no nose then and his face was to be rebuilt he had gone out to the front from the military academy and been wounded within an hour after he had gone into the front line for the first time they rebuilt his face but he came from a very old family and they could never get the nose exactly right he went to south america and worked in a bank but this was a long time ago and then we did not any of us know how it was going to be afterward we only knew then that there was always the war but that we were not going to it any more we all had the same medals except the boy with the black silk bandage across his face and he had not been at the front long enough to get any medals the tall boy with a very pale face who was to be a lawyer had been a lieutenant of arditi and had three medals of the sort we each had only one of he had lived a very long time with death and was a little detached we were all a little detached and there was nothing that held us together except that we met every afternoon at the hospital although as we walked to the cova through the tough part of town walking in the dark with light and singing coming out of the wine shops and sometimes having to walk into the street when the men and women would crowd together on the sidewalk so that we would have had to jostle them to get by we felt held together by there being something that had happened that they the people who disliked us did not understand we ourselves all understood the cova where it was rich and warm and not too brightly lighted and noisy and smoky at certain hours and there were always girls at the tables and the illustrated papers on a rack on the wall the girls at the cova were very patriotic and i found that the most patriotic people in italy were the café girls and i believe they are still patriotic the boys at first were very polite about my medals and asked me what i had done to get them i showed them the papers which were written in very beautiful language and full of fratellanza and abnegazione but which really said with the adjectives removed that i had been given the medals because i was an american after that their manner changed a little toward me although i was their friend against outsiders i was a friend but i was never really one of them after they had read the citations because it had been different with them and they had done very different things to get their medals i had been wounded it was true but we all knew that being wounded after all was really an accident i was never ashamed of the ribbons though and sometimes after the cocktail hour i would imagine myself having done all the things they had done to get their medals but walking home at night through the empty streets with the cold wind and all the shops closed trying to keep near the street lights i knew that i would never have done such things and i was very much afraid to die and often lay in bed at night by myself afraid to die and wondering how i would be when i went back to the front again the three with the medals were like hunting hawks and i was not a hawk although i might seem a hawk to those who had never hunted they the three knew better and so we drifted apart but i stayed good friends with the boy who had been wounded his first day at the front because he would never know now how he would have turned out so he could never be accepted either and i liked him because i thought perhaps he would not have turned out to be a hawk either the major who had been the great fencer did not believe in bravery and spent much time while we sat in the machines correcting my grammar he had complimented me on how i spoke italian and we talked together very easily one day i had said that italian seemed such an easy language to me that i could not take a great interest in it everything was so easy to say ah yes the major said why then do you not take up the use of grammar so we took up the use of grammar and soon italian was such a difficult language that i was afraid to talk to him until i had the grammar straight in my mind the major came very regularly to the hospital i do not think he ever missed a day although i am sure he did not believe in the machines there was a time when none of us believed in the machines and one day the major said it was all nonsense the machines were new then and it was we who were to prove them it was an idiotic idea he said a theory like another i had not learned my grammar and he said i was a stupid impossible disgrace and he was a fool to have bothered with me he was a small man and he sat straight up in his chair with his right hand thrust into the machine and looked straight ahead at the wall while the straps thumped up and down with his fingers in them what will you do when the war is over if it is over he asked me speak grammatically i will go to the states are you married no but i hope to be the more of a fool you are he said he seemed very angry a man must not marry why signor maggiore don t call me signor maggiore why must not a man marry he cannot marry he cannot marry he said angrily if he is to lose everything he should not place himself in a position to lose that he should not place himself in a position to lose he should find things he cannot lose he spoke very angrily and bitterly and looked straight ahead while he talked but why should he necessarily lose it he ll lose it the major said he was looking at the wall then he looked down at the machine and jerked his little hand out from between the straps and slapped it hard against his thigh he ll lose it he almost shouted don t argue with me then he called to the attendant who ran the machines come and turn this damned thing off he went back into the other room for the light treatment and the massage then i heard him ask the doctor if he might use his telephone and he shut the door when he came back into the room i was sitting in another machine he was wearing his cape and had his cap on and he came directly toward my machine and put his arm on my shoulder i am so sorry he said and patted me on the shoulder with his good hand i would not be rude my wife has just died you must forgive me oh i said feeling sick for him i am so sorry he stood there biting his lower lip it is very difficult he said i cannot resign myself he looked straight past me and out through the window then he began to cry i am utterly unable to resign myself he said and choked and then crying his head up looking at nothing carrying himself straight and soldierly with tears on both his cheeks and biting his lips he walked past the machines and out the door the doctor told me that the major s wife who was very young and whom he had not married until he was definitely invalided out of the war had died of pneumonia she had been sick only a few days no one expected her to die the major did not come to the hospital for three days then he came at the usual hour wearing a black band on the sleeve of his uniform when he came back there were large framed photographs around the wall of all sorts of wounds before and after they had been cured by the machines in front of the machine the major used were three photographs of hands like his that were completely restored i do not know where the doctor got them i always understood we were the first to use the machines the photographs did not make much difference to the major because he only looked out of the window hills like white elephants the hills across the valley of the ebro were long and white on this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain made of strings of bamboo beads hung across the open door into the bar to keep out flies the american and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade outside the building it was very hot and the express from barcelona would come in forty minutes it stopped at this junction for two minutes and went on to madrid what should we drink the girl asked she had taken off her hat and put it on the table it s pretty hot the man said let s drink beer dos cervezas the man said into the curtain big ones a woman asked from the doorway yes two big ones the woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads she put the felt pads and the beer glasses on the table and looked at the man and the girl the girl was looking off at the line of hills they were white in the sun and the country was brown and dry they look like white elephants she said i ve never seen one the man drank his beer no you wouldn t have i might have the man said just because you say i wouldn t have doesn t prove anything the girl looked at the bead curtain they ve painted something on it she said what does it say anis del toro it s a drink could we try it the man called listen through the curtain the woman came out from the bar four reales we want two anis del toro with water do you want it with water i don t know the girl said is it good with water it s all right you want them with water asked the woman yes with water it tastes like licorice the girl said and put the glass down that s the way with everything yes said the girl everything tastes of licorice especially all the things you ve waited so long for like absinthe oh cut it out you started it the girl said i was being amused i was having a fine time well let s try and have a fine time all right i was trying i said the mountains looked like white elephants wasn t that bright that was bright i wanted to try this new drink that s all we do isn t it look at things and try new drinks i guess so the girl looked across at the hills they re lovely hills she said they don t really look like white elephants i just meant the coloring of their skin through the trees should we have another drink all right the warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table the beer s nice and cool the man said it s lovely the girl said it s really an awfully simple operation jig the man said it s not really an operation at all the girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on i know you wouldn t mind it jig it s really not anything it s just to let the air in the girl did not say anything i ll go with you and i ll stay with you all the time they just let the air in and then it s all perfectly natural then what will we do afterward we ll be fine afterward just like we were before what makes you think so that s the only thing that bothers us it s the only thing that s made us unhappy the girl looked at the bead curtain put her hand out and took hold of two of the strings of beads and you think then we ll be all right and be happy i know we will you don t have to be afraid i ve known lots of people that have done it so have i said the girl and afterward they were all so happy well the man said if you don t want to you don t have to i wouldn t have you do it if you didn t want to but i know it s perfectly simple and you really want to i think it s the best thing to do but i don t want you to do it if you don t really want to and if i do it you ll be happy and things will be like they were and you ll love me i love you now you know i love you i know but if i do it then it will be nice again if i say things are like white elephants and you ll like it i ll love it i love it now but i just can t think about it you know how i get when i worry if i do it you won t ever worry i won t worry about that because it s perfectly simple then i ll do it because i don t care about me what do you mean i don t care about me well i care about you oh yes but i don t care about me and i ll do it and then everything will be fine i don t want you to do it if you feel that way the girl stood up and walked to the end of the station across on the other side were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the ebro far away beyond the river were mountains the shadow of a cloud moved across the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees and we could have all this she said and we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible what did you say i said we could have everything we can have everything no we can t we can have the whole world no we can t we can go everywhere no we can t it isn t ours any more it s ours no it isn t and once they take it away you never get it back but they haven t taken it away we ll wait and see come on back in the shade he said you mustn t feel that way i don t feel any way the girl said i just know things i don t want you to do anything that you don t want to do nor that isn t good for me she said i know could we have another beer all right but you ve got to realize i realize the girl said can t we maybe stop talking they sat down at the table and the girl looked across at the hills on the dry side of the valley and the man looked at her and at the table you ve got to realize he said that i don t want you to do it if you don t want to i m perfectly willing to go through with it if it means anything to you doesn t it mean anything to you we could get along of course it does but i don t want anybody but you i don t want any one else and i know it s perfectly simple yes you know it s perfectly simple it s all right for you to say that but i do know it would you do something for me now i d do anything for you would you please please please please please please please stop talking he did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the station there were labels on them from all the hotels where they had spent nights but i don t want you to he said i don t care anything about it i ll scream the girl said the woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and put them down on the damp felt pads the train comes in five minutes she said what did she say asked the girl that the train is coming in five minutes the girl smiled brightly at the woman to thank her i d better take the bags over to the other side of the station the man said she smiled at him all right then come back and we ll finish the beer he picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to the other tracks he looked up the tracks but could not see the train coming back he walked through the barroom where people waiting for the train were drinking he drank an anis at the bar and looked at the people they were all waiting reasonably for the train he went out through the bead curtain she was sitting at the table and smiled at him do you feel better he asked i feel fine she said there s nothing wrong with me i

house nick walked up the two steps and pushed the bell a woman came to the door is ole andreson here do you want to see him yes if he s in nick followed the woman up a flight of stairs and back to the

damned awful well said george you better not think about it che ti dice la patria the road of the pass was hard and smooth and not yet dusty in the early morning below were the hills with oak and chestnut trees and far away below was the sea on the other side were snowy mountains we came down from the pass through wooded country there were bags of charcoal piled beside the road and through the trees we saw charcoal burners huts it was sunday and the road rising and falling but always dropping away from the altitude of the pass went through the scrub woods and through villages outside the villages there were fields with vines the fields were brown and the vines coarse and thick the houses were white and in the streets the men in their sunday clothes were playing bowls against the walls of some of the houses there were pear trees their branches candelabraed against the white walls the pear trees had been sprayed and the walls of the houses were stained a metallic blue green by the spray vapor there were small clearings around the villages where the vines grew and then the woods in a village twenty kilometres above spezia there was a crowd in the square and a young man carrying a suitcase came up to the car and asked us to take him in to spezia there are only two places and they are occupied i said we had an old ford coupé i will ride on the outside you will be uncomfortable that makes nothing i must go to spezia should we take him i asked guy he seems to be going anyway guy said the young man handed in a parcel through the window look after this he said two men tied his suitcase on the back of the car above our suitcases he shook hands with every one explained that to a fascist and a man as used to travelling as himself there was no discomfort and climbed up on the running board on the left hand side of the car holding on inside his right arm through the open window you can start he said the crowd waved he waved with his free hand what did he say guy asked me that we could start isn t he nice guy said the road followed a river across the river were mountains the sun was taking the frost out of the grass it was bright and cold and the air came through the open wind shield how do you think he likes it out there guy was looking up the road his view out of his side of the car was blocked by our guest the young man projected from the side of the car like the figurehead of a ship he had turned his coat collar up and pulled his hat down and his nose looked cold in the wind maybe he ll get enough of it guy said that s the side our bum tire s on oh he d leave us if we blew out i said he wouldn t get his travelling clothes dirty well i don t mind him guy said except the way he leans out on the turns the woods were gone the road had left the river to climb the radiator was boiling the young man looked annoyedly and suspiciously at the steam and rusty water the engine was grinding with both guy s feet on the first speed pedal up and up back and forth and up and finally out level the grinding stopped and in the new quiet there was a great churning bubbling in the radiator we were at the top of the last range above spezia and the sea the road descended with short barely rounded turns our guest hung out on the turns and nearly pulled the top heavy car over you can t tell him not to i said to guy it s his sense of self preservation the great italian sense the greatest italian sense we came down around curves through deep dust the dust powdering the olive trees spezia spread below along the sea the road flattened outside the town our guest put his head in the window i want to stop stop it i said to guy we slowed up at the side of the road the young man got down went to the back of the car and untied the suitcase i stop here so you won t get into trouble carrying passengers he said my package i handed him the package he reached in his pocket how much do i owe you nothing why not i don t know i said then thanks the young man said not thank you or thank you very much or thank you a thousand times all of which you formerly said in italy to a man when he handed you a time table or explained about a direction the young man uttered the lowest form of the word thanks and looked after us suspiciously as guy started the car i waved my hand at him he was too dignified to reply we went on into spezia that s a young man that will go a long way in italy i said to guy well said guy he went twenty kilometres with us a meal in spezia we came into spezia looking for a place to eat the street was wide and the houses high and yellow we followed the tram track into the center of town on the walls of the houses were stencilled eyebugging portraits of mussolini with hand painted vivas the double v in black paint with drippings of paint down the wall side streets went down to the harbor it was bright and the people were all out for sunday the stone paving had been sprinkled and there were damp stretches in the dust we went close to the curb to avoid a tram let s eat somewhere simple guy said we stopped opposite two restaurant signs we were standing across the street and i was buying the papers the two restaurants were side by side a woman standing in the doorway of one smiled at us and we crossed the street and went in it was dark inside and at the back of the room three girls were sitting at a table with an old woman across from us at another table sat a sailor he sat there neither eating nor drinking further back a young man in a blue suit was writing at a table his hair was pomaded and shining and he was very smartly dressed and clean cut looking the light came through the doorway and through the window where vegetables fruit steaks and chops were arranged in a show case a girl came and took our order and another girl stood in the doorway we noticed that she wore nothing under her house dress the girl who took our order put her arm around guy s neck while we were looking at the menu there were three girls in all and they all took turns going and standing in the doorway the old woman at the table in the back of the room spoke to them and they sat down again with her there was no doorway leading from the room except into the kitchen a curtain hung over it the girl who had taken our order came in from the kitchen with spaghetti she put it on the table and brought a bottle of red wine and sat down at the table well i said to guy you wanted to eat some place simple this isn t simple this is complicated what do you say asked the girl are you germans south germans i said the south germans are a gentle lovable people don t understand she said what s the mechanics of this place guy asked do i have to let her put her arm around my neck certainly i said mussolini has abolished the brothels this is a restaurant the girl wore a one piece dress she leaned forward against the table and put her hands on her breasts and smiled she smiled better on one side than on the other and turned the good side toward us the charm of the good side had been enhanced by some event which had smoothed the other side of her nose in as warm wax can be smoothed her nose however did not look like warm wax it was very cold and firmed only smoothed in you like me she asked guy he adores you i said but he doesn t speak italian ich spreche deutsch she said and stroked guy s hair speak to the lady in your native tongue guy where do you come from asked the lady potsdam and you will stay here now for a little while in this so dear spezia i asked tell her we have to go said guy tell her we are very ill and have no money my friend is a misogynist i said an old german misogynist tell him i love him i told him will you shut your mouth and get us out of here guy said the lady had placed another arm around his neck tell him he is mine she said i told him will you get us out of here you are quarrelling the lady said you do not love one another we are germans i said proudly old south germans tell him he is a beautiful boy the lady said guy is thirty eight and takes some pride in the fact that he is taken for a travelling salesman in france you are a beautiful boy i said who says so guy asked

tell her i take a cold bath every morning guy said the signor takes a cold bath every morning no understand the lady said across from us the property sailor had not moved no one in the place paid any attention to him we want the bill i said oh no you must stay listen the clean cut young man said from the table where he was writing let them go these two are worth nothing the lady took my hand you won t stay you won t ask him to stay we have to go i said we have to get to pisa or if possible firenze tonight we can amuse ourselves in those cities at the end of the day it is now the day in the day we must cover distance to stay a little while is nice to travel is necessary during the light of day listen the clean cut young man said don t bother to talk with these two i tell you they are worth nothing and i know bring us the bill i said she brought the bill from the old woman and went back and sat at the table another girl came in from the kitchen she walked the length of the room and stood in the doorway don t bother with these two the clean cut young man said in a wearied voice come and eat they are worth nothing we paid the bill and stood up all the girls the old woman and the clean cut young man sat down at table together the property sailor sat with his head in his hands no one had spoken to him all the time we were at lunch the girl brought us our change that the old woman counted out for her and went back to her place at the table we left a tip on the table and went out when we were seated in the car ready to start the girl came out and stood in the door we started and i waved to her she did not wave but stood there looking after us after the rain it was raining hard when we passed through the suburbs of genoa and even going very slowly behind the tram cars and the motor trucks liquid mud splashed on to the sidewalks so that people stepped into doorways as they saw us coming in san pier d arena the industrial suburb outside of genoa there is a wide street with two car tracks and we drove down the center to avoid sending the mud on to the men going home from work on our left was the mediterranean there was a big sea running and waves broke and the wind blew the spray against the car a river bed that when we had passed going into italy had been wide stony and dry was running brown and up to the banks the brown water discolored the sea and as the waves thinned and cleared in breaking the light came through the yellow water and the crests detached by the wind blew across the road a big car passed us going fast and a sheet of muddy water rose up and over our wind shield and radiator the automatic wind shield cleaner moved back and forth spreading the film over the glass we stopped and ate lunch at sestri there was no heat in the restaurant and we kept our hats and coats on we could see the car outside through the window it was covered with mud and was stopped beside some boats that had been pulled up beyond the waves in the restaurant you could see your breath the pasta asciutta was good the wine tasted of alum and we poured water in it afterward the waiter brought beefsteak and fried potatoes a man and a woman sat at the far end of the restaurant he was middle aged and she was young and wore black all during the meal she would blow out her breath in the cold damp air the man would look at it and shake his head they ate without talking and the man held her hand under the table she was good looking and they seemed very sad they had a travelling bag with them we had the papers and i read the account of the shanghai fighting aloud to guy after the meal he left with the waiter in search for a place which did not exist in the restaurant and i cleaned off the wind shield the lights and the license plates with a rag guy came back and we backed the car out and started the waiter had taken him across the road and into an old house the people in the house were suspicious and the waiter had remained with guy to see nothing was stolen although i don t know how me not being a plumber they expected me to steal anything guy said as we came up on a headland beyond the town the wind struck the car and nearly tipped it over it s good it blows us away from the sea guy said well i said they drowned shelley somewhere along here that was down by viareggio guy said do you remember what we came to this country for yes i said but we didn t get it we ll be out of it tonight if we can get past ventimiglia we ll see i don t like to drive this coast at night it was early afternoon and the sun was out below the sea was blue with whitecaps running toward savona back beyond the cape the brown and blue water joined out ahead of us a tramp steamer was going up the coast can you still see genoa guy asked oh yes that next big cape ought to put it out of sight we ll see it a long time yet i can still see portofino cape behind it finally we could not see genoa i looked back as we came out and there was only the sea and below in the bay a line of beach with fishing boats and above on the side of the hill a town and then capes far down the coast it s gone now i said to guy oh it s been gone a long time now but we couldn t be sure till we got way out there was a sign with a picture of an s turn and svolta pericolosa the road curved around the headland and the wind blew through the crack in the wind shield below the cape was a flat stretch beside the sea the wind had dried the mud and the wheels were beginning to lift dust on the flat road we passed a fascist riding a bicycle a heavy revolver in a holster on his back he held the middle of the road on his bicycle and we turned out for him he looked up at us as we passed ahead there was a railway crossing and as we came toward it the gates went down as we waited the fascist came up on his bicycle the train went by and guy started the engine wait the bicycle man shouted from behind the car your number s dirty i got out with a rag the number had been cleaned at lunch you can read it i said you think so read it i cannot read it it is dirty i wiped it off with the rag how s that twenty five lire what i said you could have read it it s only dirty from the state of the roads you don t like italian roads they are dirty fifty lire he spat in the road your car is dirty and you are dirty too good and give me a receipt with your name he took out a receipt book made in duplicate and perforated so one side could be given to the customer and the other side filled in and kept as a stub there was no carbon to record what the customer s ticket said give me fifty lire he wrote in indelible pencil tore out the slip and handed it to me i read it this is for twenty five lire a mistake he said and changed the twenty five to fifty and now the other side make it fifty in the part you keep he smiled a beautiful italian smile and wrote something on the receipt stub holding it so i could not see go on he said before your number gets dirty again we drove for two hours after it was dark and slept in mentone that night it seemed very cheerful and clean and sane and lovely we had driven from ventimiglia to pisa and florence across the romagna to rimini back through forli imola bologna parma piacenza and genoa to ventimiglia again the whole trip had taken only ten days naturally in such a short trip we had no

a heavyweight he didn t have much legs jack stood about half a head taller than he did hello jack he said his face was plenty marked up hello said jack how you feel good walcott says he dropped the towel from around his waist and stood on the scales he had the widest shoulders and back you ever saw one hundred and forty six pounds and twelve ounces walcott stepped off and grinned at jack well john says to him jack s spotting you about four pounds more than that when i come in kid walcott says i m going to go and eat now we went back and jack got dressed he s a pretty tough looking boy jack

his shoes and his coat and lay down for a while i wrote a letter i looked over a couple of times and jack wasn t sleeping he was lying perfectly still but every once in a while his eyes would open finally he sits up want to play some cribbage jerry he says sure i said he went over to his suitcase and got out the cards and the cribbage board we played cribbage and he won three dollars off me

we went upstairs and jack played cribbage with john again and won two dollars and a half off him jack was feeling pretty good john had a bag with him with all his stuff in it jack took off his shirt and collar and put on a jersey and a sweater so he wouldn t catch cold when he came out and put his ring clothes and his bathrobe in a bag you all ready john asks him i ll call up and have them get a taxi pretty soon the telephone rang and they said the taxi was waiting we rode down in the elevator and went out through the lobby and got in a taxi and rode around to the garden it was raining hard but there was a lot of people outside on the streets the garden was sold out as we came in on our way to the dressing room i saw how full it was it looked like half a mile down to the ring it was all dark just the lights over the ring it s a good thing with this rain they didn t try and pull this fight in the ball park john said they got a good crowd jack says this is a fight that would draw a lot more than the garden could hold you can t tell about the weather jack says john came to the door of the dressing room and poked his head in jack was sitting there with his bathrobe on he had his arms folded and was looking at the floor john had a couple of handlers with him they looked over his shoulder jack looked up is he in he asked he s just gone down john said we started down walcott was just getting into the ring the crowd gave him a big hand he climbed through between the ropes and put his two fists together and smiled and shook them at the crowd first at one side of the ring then at the other and then sat down jack got a good hand coming down through the crowd jack is irish and the irish always get a pretty good hand an irishman don t draw in new york like a jew or an italian but they always get a good hand jack climbed up and bent down to go through the ropes and walcott came over from his corner and pushed the rope down for jack to go through the crowd thought that was wonderful walcott put his hand on jack s shoulder and they stood there just for a second so you re going to be one of these popular champions jack says to him take your goddam hand off my shoulder be yourself walcott says this is all great for the crowd how gentlemanly the boys are before the fight how they wish each other luck solly freedman came over to our comer while jack is bandaging his hands and john is over in walcott s corner jack puts his thumb through the slit in the bandage and then wrapped his hand nice and smooth i taped it around the wrist and twice across the knuckles hey freedman says where do you get all that tape feel of it jack says it s soft ain t it don t be a hick freedman stands there all the time while jack bandages the other hand and one of the boys that s going to handle him brings the gloves and i pull them on and work them around say freedman jack asks what nationality is this walcott i don t know solly says he s some sort of a dane he s a bohemian the lad who brought the gloves said the referee called them out to the center of the ring and jack walks out walcott comes out smiling they met and the referee put his arm on each of their shoulders hello popularity jack says to walcott be yourself what do you call yourself walcott for jack says didn t you know he was a nigger listen says the referee and he gives them the same old line once walcott interrupts him he grabs jack s arm and says can i hit when he s got me like this keep your hands off me jack says there ain t no moving pictures of this they went back to their corners i lifted the bathrobe off jack and he leaned on the ropes and flexed his knees a couple of times and scuffed his shoes in the rosin the gong rang and jack turned quick and went out walcott came toward him and they touched gloves and as soon as walcott dropped his hands jack jumped his left into his face twice there wasn t anybody ever boxed better than jack walcott was after him going forward all the time with his chin on his chest he s a hooker and he carries his hands pretty low all he knows is to get in there and sock but every time he gets in there close jack has the left hand in his face it s just as though it s automatic jack just raises the left hand up and it s in walcott s face three or four times jack brings the right over but walcott gets it on the shoulder or high up on the head he s just like all these hookers the only thing he s afraid of is another one of the same kind he s covered everywhere you can hurt him he don t care about a left hand in his face after about four rounds jack has him bleeding bad and his face all cut up but every time walcott s got in close he s socked so hard he s got two big red patches on both sides just below jack s ribs every time he gets in close jack ties him up then gets one hand loose and uppercuts him but when walcott gets his hands loose he socks jack in the body so they can hear it outside in the street he s a socker it goes along like that for three rounds more they don t talk any they re working all the time we worked over jack plenty too in between the rounds he don t look good at all but he never does much work in the ring he don t move around much and that left hand is just automatic it s just like it was connected with walcott s face and jack just had to wish it in every time jack is always calm in close and he doesn t waste any juice he knows everything about working in close too and he s getting away with a lot of stuff while they were in our corner i watched him tie walcott up get his right hand loose turn it and come up with an uppercut that got walcott s nose with the heel of the glove walcott was bleeding bad and leaned his nose on jack s shoulder so as to give jack some of it too and jack sort of lifted his shoulder sharp and caught him against the nose and then brought down the right hand and did the same thing again walcott was sore as hell by the time they d gone five rounds he hated jack s guts jack wasn t sore that is he wasn t any sorer than he always was he certainly did used to make the fellows he fought hate boxing that was why he hated kid lewis so he never got the kid s goat kid lewis always had about three new dirty things jack couldn t do jack was as safe as a church all the time he was in there as long as he was strong he certainly was treating walcott rough the funny thing was it looked as though jack was an open classic boxer that was because he had all that stuff too after the seventh round jack says my left s getting heavy from then he started to take a beating it didn t show at first but instead of him running the fight it was walcott was running it instead of being safe all the time now he was in trouble he couldn t keep him out with the left hand now it looked as though it was the same as ever only now instead of walcott s punches just missing him they were just hitting him he took an awful beating in the body what s the round jack asked the eleventh i can t stay jack says my legs are going bad walcott had been just hitting him for a long time it was like a baseball catcher pulls the ball and takes some of the shock off from now on walcott commenced to land solid he certainly was a socking machine jack was just trying to block everything now it didn t show what an awful beating he was taking in between the rounds i worked on his legs the muscles would flutter under my hands all the time i was rubbing them he was sick as hell how s it go he asked john turning around his face all swollen it s his fight i think i can last jack says i don t want this bohunk to stop me it was going just the way he thought it would he knew he couldn t beat walcott he wasn t strong any more he was all right though his money was all right and now he wanted to finish it off right to please himself he didn t want to be knocked out the gong rang and we pushed him out he went out slow walcott came right out after him jack put the left in his face and walcott took it came in under it and started working on jack s body jack tried to tie him up and it was just like trying to hold on to a buzz saw jack broke away from it and missed with the right walcott clipped him with a left hook and jack went down he went down on his hands and knees and looked at us the referee started counting jack was watching us and shaking his head at eight john motioned to him you couldn t hear on account of the crowd jack got up the referee had been holding walcott back with one arm while he counted when jack was on his feet walcott started toward him watch yourself jimmy i heard solly freedman yell to him walcott came up to jack looking at him jack stuck the left hand at him walcott just shook his head he backed jack up against the ropes measured him and then hooked the left very light to the side of jack s head and socked the right into the body as hard as he could sock just as low as he could get it he must have hit him five inches below the belt i thought the eyes would come out of jack s head they stuck way out his mouth come open the referee grabbed walcott jack stepped forward if he went down there went fifty thousand bucks he walked as though all his insides were going to fall out it wasn t low he said it was a accident the crowd were yelling so you couldn t hear anything i m all right jack says they were right in front of us the referee looks at john and then he shakes his head come on you polak son of a bitch jack says to walcott john was hanging onto the ropes he had the towel ready to chuck in jack was standing just a little way out from the ropes he took a step forward i saw the sweat come out on his face like somebody had squeezed it and a big drop went down his nose come on and fight jack says to walcott the referee looked at john and waved walcott on go in there you slob he says walcott went in he didn t know what to do either he never thought jack could have stood it jack put the left in his face there was such a hell of a lot of yelling going on they were right in front of us walcott hit him twice jack s face was the worst thing i ever saw the look on it he was holding himself and all his body together and it all showed on his face all the time he was thinking and holding his body in where it was busted then he started to sock his face looked awful all the time he started to sock with his hands low down by his side swinging at walcott walcott covered up and jack was swinging wild at walcott s head then he swung the left and it hit walcott in the groin and the right hit walcott right bang where he d hit jack way low below the belt walcott went down and grabbed himself there and rolled and twisted around the referee grabbed jack and pushed him toward his corner john jumps into the ring there was all this yelling going on the referee was talking with the judges and then the announcer got into the ring with the megaphone and says walcott on a foul the referee is talking to john and he says what could i do jack wouldn t take the foul then when he s groggy he fouls him he d lost it anyway john says jack s sitting on the chair i ve got his gloves off and he s holding himself in down there with both hands when he s got something supporting it his face doesn t look so bad go over and say you re sorry john says into his ear it ll look good jack stands up and the sweat comes out all over his face i put the bathrobe around him and he holds himself in with one hand under the bathrobe and goes across the ring they ve picked walcott up and they re working on him there re a lot of people in walcott s corner nobody speaks to jack he leans over walcott i m sorry jack says i didn t mean to foul you walcott doesn t say anything he looks too damned sick well you re the champion now jack says to him i hope you get a hell of a lot of fun out of it leave the kid alone solly freedman says hello solly jack says i m sorry i fouled your boy freedman just looks at him jack went to his corner walking that funny jerky way and we got him down through the ropes and through the reporters tables and out down the aisle a lot of people want to slap jack on the back he goes out through all that mob in his bathrobe to the dressing room it s a popular win for walcott that s the way the money was bet in the garden once we got inside the dressing room jack lay down and shut his eyes we want to get to the hotel and get a doctor john says i m all busted inside jack says i m sorry as hell jack john says it s all right jack says he lies there with his eyes shut they certainly tried a nice

think when it means that much money jack says you re some boy jack john says no jack says it was nothing a simple enquiry outside the snow was higher than the window the sunlight came in through the window and shone on a map on the pineboard wall of the hut the sun was high and the light came in over the top of the snow a trench had been cut along the open side of the hut and each clear day the sun shining on the wall reflected heat against the snow and widened the trench it was late march the major sat at a table against the wall his adjutant sat at another table around the major s eyes were two white circles where his snow glasses had protected his face from the sun on the snow the rest of his face had been burned and then tanned and then burned through the tan his nose was swollen and there were edges of loose skin where blisters had been while he worked at the papers he put the fingers of his left hand into a saucer of oil and then spread the oil over his face touching it very gently with the tips of his fingers he was very careful to drain his fingers on the edge of the saucer so there was only a film of oil on them and after he had stroked his forehead and his cheeks he stroked his nose very delicately between his fingers when he had finished he stood up took the saucer of oil and went into the small room of the hut where he slept i m going to take a little sleep he said to the adjutant in that army an adjutant is not a commissioned officer you will finish up yes signor maggiore the adjutant answered he leaned back in his chair and yawned he took a paper covered book out of the pocket of his coat and opened it then laid it down on the table and lit his pipe he leaned forward on the table to read and puffed at his pipe then he closed the book and put it back in his pocket he had too much paper work to get through he could not enjoy reading until it was done outside the sun went behind a mountain and there was no more light on the wall of the hut a soldier came in and put some pine branches chopped into irregular lengths into the stove be soft pinin the adjutant said to him the major is sleeping pinin was the major s orderly he was a dark faced boy and he fixed the stove putting the pine wood in carefully shut the door and went into the back of the hut again the adjutant went on with his papers tonani the major called signor maggiore send pinin in to me pinin the adjutant called pinin came into the room the major wants you the adjutant said pinin walked across the main room of the hut toward the major s door he knocked on the halfopened door signor maggiore come in the adjutant heard the major say and shut the door inside the room the major lay on his bunk pinin stood beside the bunk the major lay with his head on the rucksack that he had stuffed with spare clothing to make a pillow his long burned oiled face looked at pinin his hands lay on the blankets you are nineteen he asked yes signor maggiore you have ever been in love how do you mean signor maggiore in love with a girl i have been with girls i did not ask that i asked if you had been in love with a girl yes signor maggiore you are in love with this girl now you don t

was no answer from the next room he can not hear the major said and you are quite sure that you love a girl i am sure and the major looked at him quickly that you are not corrupt i don t know what you mean corrupt all right the major said you needn t be superior pinin looked at the floor the major looked at his brown face down and up him and at his hands then he went on not smiling and you don t really want the major paused pinin looked at the floor that your great desire isn t really pinin looked at the floor the major leaned his head back on the rucksack and smiled he was really relieved life in the army was too complicated you re a good boy he said you re a good boy pinin but don t be superior and be careful some one else doesn t come along and take you pinin stood still beside the bunk don t be afraid the major said his hands were folded on the blankets i won t touch you you can go back to your platoon if you like but you had better stay on as my servant you ve less chance of being killed do you want anything of me signer maggiore no the major said go on and get on with whatever you were doing leave the door open when you go out pinin went out leaving the door open the adjutant looked up at him as he walked awkwardly across the room and out the door pinin was flushed and moved differently than he had moved when he brought in the wood for the fire the adjutant looked after him and smiled pinin came in with more wood for the stove the major lying on his bunk looking at his cloth covered helmet and his snowglasses that hung from a nail on the wall heard him walk across the floor the little devil he thought i wonder if he lied to me ten indians after one fourth of july nick driving home late from town in the big wagon with joe garner and his family passed nine

close together on the front seat nick sat between the two boys the road came out into a clearing right here was where pa ran over the skunk it was further on it don t make no difference where it was

inside and came out with a lamp in her hand carl and nick unloaded the things from the back of the wagon frank sat on the front seat to drive to the barn and put up the horses nick went up the steps

eat no i can t will you tell carl his mother wants him all right good night nickie nick walked barefoot along the path through the meadow below the barn the path was smooth and the dew was cool on his bare feet he climbed a fence at the end of the meadow went down through a ravine his feet wet in the swamp mud and then climbed up through the dry beech woods until he saw the lights of the cottage he climbed over the fence and walked around to the front porch through the window he saw his father sitting by the table reading in the light from the big lamp nick opened the door and went in well nickie his father said was it a good day i had a swell time dad it was a swell fourth of july are you hungry you bet what did you do with your shoes i left them in the wagon at garner s come on out to the kitchen nick s father went ahead with the lamp he stopped and lifted the lid of the ice box nick went on into the kitchen his father brought in a piece of cold chicken on a plate and a pitcher of milk and put them on the table before nick he put down the lamp there s some pie too he said will that hold you it s grand his father sat down in a chair beside the oil cloth covered table he made a big shadow on the kitchen wall who won the ball game petoskey five to three his father sat watching him eat and filled his glass from the milk pitcher nick drank and wiped his mouth on his napkin his father reached over to the shelf for the pie he cut nick a big piece it was huckleberry pie what did you do dad i went out fishing in the morning what did you get only perch his father sat watching nick eat the pie what did you do this afternoon nick asked i went for a walk up by the indian camp did you see anybody the indians were all in town getting drunk didn t you see anybody at all i saw

they in the woods nick asked up back of the camp nick looked at his plate his father said you better go to bed nick all right nick went into his room undressed and got into bed he heard his father moving around in the living room nick lay in the bed with his face in the pillow my heart s broken he thought if i feel this way my heart must be broken after a while he heard his father blow out the lamp and go into his own room he heard a wind come up in the trees outside and felt it come in cool through the screen he lay for a long time with his face in the pillow and after a while he forgot to think about prudence and finally he went to sleep when he awoke in the night he heard the wind in the hemlock trees outside the cottage and the waves of the lake coming in on the shore and he went back to sleep in the morning there was a big wind blowing and the waves were running high up on the beach and he was awake a long time before he remembered that his heart was broken a canary for one the train passed very quickly a long red stone house with a garden and four thick palm trees with tables under them in the shade on the other side was the sea then there was a cutting through red stone and clay and the sea was only occasionally and far below against rocks i bought him in palermo the american lady said we only had an hour ashore and it was sunday morning the man wanted to be paid in dollars and i gave him a dollar and a half he really sings very beautifully it was very hot in the train and it was very hot in the lit salon compartment there was no breeze came through the open window the american lady pulled the window blind down and there was no more sea even occasionally on the other side there was glass then the corridor then an open window and outside the window were dusty trees and an oiled road and flat fields of grapes with gray stone hills behind them there was smoke from many tall chimneys coming into marseilles and the train slowed down and followed one track through many others into the station the train stayed twenty five minutes in the station at marseilles and the american lady bought a copy of the daily mail and a half bottle of evian water she walked a little way along the station platform but she stayed near the steps of the car because at cannes where it stopped for twelve minutes the train had left with no signal of departure and she had gotten on only just in time the american lady was a little deaf and she was afraid that perhaps signals of departure were given and that she did not hear them the train left the station in marseilles and there was not only the switchyards and the factory smoke but looking back the town of marseilles and the harbor with stone hills behind it and the last of the sun on the water as it was getting dark the train passed a farmhouse burning in a field motorcars were stopped along the road and bedding and things from inside the farmhouse were spread in the field many people were watching the house burn after it was dark the train was in avignon people got on and off at the news stand frenchmen returning to paris bought that day s french papers on the station platform were negro soldiers they wore brown uniforms and were tall and their faces shone close under the electric light their faces were very black and they were too tall to stare the train left avignon station with the negroes standing there a short white sergeant was with them inside the lit salon compartment the porter had pulled down the three beds from inside the wall and prepared them for sleeping in the night the american lady lay without sleeping because the train was a rapide and went very fast and she was afraid of the speed in the night the american lady s bed was the one next to the window the canary from palermo a cloth spread over his cage was out of the draft in the corridor that went into the compartment wash room there was a blue light outside the compartment and all night the train went very fast and the american lady lay awake and waited for a wreck in the morning the train was near paris and after the american lady had come out from the washroom looking very wholesome and middle aged and american in spite of not having slept and had taken the cloth off the birdcage and hung the cage in the sun she went back to the restaurant car for breakfast when she came back to the lit salon compartment again the beds had been pushed back into the wall and made into seats the canary was shaking his feathers in the sunlight that came through the open window and the train was much nearer paris he loves the sun the american lady said he ll sing now in a little while the canary shook his feathers and pecked into them i ve always loved birds the american lady said i m taking him home to my little girl there he s singing now the canary chirped and the feathers on his throats stood out then he dropped his bill and pecked into his feathers again the train crossed a river and passed through a very carefully tended forest the train passed through many outside of paris towns there were tram cars in the towns and big advertisements for the belle jardinière and dubonnet and pernod on the walls toward the train all that the train passed through looked as though it were before breakfast for several minutes i had not listened to the american lady who was talking to my wife is your husband american too asked the lady yes said my wife we re both americans i thought you were english oh no perhaps that was because i wore braces i said i had started to say suspenders and changed it to braces in the mouth to keep my english character the american lady did not hear she was really quite deaf she read lips and i had not looked toward her i had looked out of the window she went on talking to my wife i m so glad you re americans american men make the best husbands the american lady was saying that was why we left the continent you know my daughter fell in love with a man in vevey she stopped they were simply madly in love she stopped again i took her away of course did she get over it asked my wife i don t think so said the american lady she wouldn t eat anything and she wouldn t sleep at all i ve tried so very hard but she doesn t seem to take an interest in anything she doesn t care about things i couldn t have her marrying a foreigner she paused some one a very good friend told me once no foreigner can make an american girl a good husband no said my wife i suppose not the american lady admired my wife s travelling coat and it turned out that the american lady had bought her own clothes for twenty years now from the same maison de couture in the rue saint honoré they had her measurements and a vendeuse who knew her and her tastes picked the dresses out for her and they were sent to america they came to the post office near where she lived up town in new york and the duty was never exorbitant because they opened the dresses there in the postoffice to appraise them and they were always very simple looking and with no gold lace nor ornaments that would make the dresses look expensive before the present vendeuse named thérèse there had been another vendeuse named amélie altogether there had only been these two in the twenty years it had always been the same couturier prices however had gone up the exchange though equalized that they had her daughter s measurements now too she was grown up and there was not much chance of their changing now the train was now coming into paris the fortifications were levelled but grass had not grown there were many cars standing on tracks brown wooden restaurant cars and brown wooden sleeping cars that would go to italy at five o clock that night if that train still left at five the cars were marked paris rome and cars with seats on the roofs that went back and forth to the suburbs with at certain hours people in all the seats and on the roofs if that were the way it were still done and passing were the white walls and many windows of houses nothing had eaten any breakfast americans make the best husbands the american lady said to my wife i was getting down the bags american men are the only men in the world to marry how long ago did you leave vevey asked my wife two years ago this fall it s her you know that i m taking the canary to was the man your daughter was in love with a swiss yes said the american lady he was from a very good family in vevey he was going to be an engineer they met there in vevey they used to go on long walks together i know vevey said my wife we were there on our honeymoon were you really that must have been lovely i had no idea of course that she d fall in love with him it was a very lovely place said my wife yes said the american lady isn t it lovely where did you stop there we stayed at the trois couronnes said my wife it s such a fine old hotel said the american lady yes said my wife we had a very fine room and in the fall the country was lovely were you there in the fall yes said my wife we were passing three cars that had been in a wreck they were splintered open and the roofs sagged in look i said there s been a wreck the american lady looked and saw the last car i was afraid of just that all night she said i have terrific presentiments about things sometimes i ll never travel on a rapide again at night there must be other comfortable trains that don t go so fast then the train was in the dark of the gare de lyons and then stopped and porters came up to the windows i handed bags through the windows and we were out on the dim longness of the platform and the american lady put herself in charge of one of three men from cook s who said just a moment madame and i ll look for your name the porter brought a truck and piled on the baggage and my wife said good by and i said goodby to the american lady whose name had been found by the man from cook s on a typewritten page in a sheaf of typewritten pages which he replaced in his pocket we followed the porter with the truck down the long cement platform beside the train at the end was a gate and a man took the tickets we were returning to paris to set up separate residences an alpine idyll it was hot coming down into the val ley even in the early morning the sun melted the snow from the skis we were carrying and dried the wood it was spring in the valley but the sun was very hot we came along the road into galtur carrying our skis and rucksacks as we passed the churchyard a burial was just over i said grüss gott to the priest as he walked past us coming out of the churchyard the priest bowed it s funny a priest never speaks to you john said you d think they d like to say grüss gott they never answer john said we stopped in the road and watched the sexton shovelling in the new earth a peasant with a black beard and high leather boots stood beside the grave the sexton stopped shovelling and straightened his back the peasant in the high boots took the spade from the sexton and went on filling in the grave spreading the earth evenly as a man spreading manure in a garden in the bright may morning the grave filling looked unreal i could not imagine any one being dead imagine being buried on a day like this i said to john i wouldn t like it well i said we don t have to do it we went on up the road past the houses of the town to the inn we had been skiing in the silvretta for a month and it was good to be down in the valley in the silvretta the skiing had been all right but it was spring skiing the snow was good only in the early morning and again in the evening the rest of the time it was spoiled by the sun we were both tired of the sun you could not get away from the sun the only shadows were made by rocks or by the hut that was built under the protection of a rock beside a glacier and in the shade the sweat froze in your underclothing you could not sit outside the hut without dark glasses it was pleasant to be burned black but the sun had been very tiring you could not rest in it i was glad to be down away from snow it was too late in the spring to be up in the silvretta i was a little tired of skiing we had stayed too long i could taste the snow water we had been drinking melted off the tin roof of the hut the taste was a part of the way i felt about skiing i was glad there were other things beside skiing and i was glad to be down away from the unnatural high mountain spring into this may morning in the valley the innkeeper sat on the porch of the inn his chair tipped back against the wall beside him sat the cook ski heil said the innkeeper heil we said and leaned the skis against the wall and took off our packs how was it up above asked the innkeeper schön a little too much sun yes there s too much sun this time of year the cook sat on in his chair the innkeeper went in with us and unlocked his office and brought out our mail there was a bundle of letters and some papers let s get some beer john said good we ll drink it inside the proprietor brought two bottles and we drank them while we read the letters we better have some more beer john said a girl brought it this time she smiled as she opened the bottles many letters she said yes many prosit she said and went out taking the empty bottles i d forgotten what beer tasted like i hadn t john said up in the hut i used to think about it a lot well i said we ve got it now you oughtn t to ever do anything too long no we were up there too long too damn long john said it s no good doing a thing too long the sun came through the open window and shone through the beer bottles on the table the bottles were half full there was a little froth on the beer in the bottles not much because it was very cold it collared up when you poured it into the tall glasses i looked out of the open window at the white road the trees beside the road were dusty beyond was a green field and a stream there were trees along the stream and a mill with a water wheel through the open side of the mill i saw a long log and a saw in it rising and falling no one seemed to be tending it there were four crows walking in the green field one crow sat in a tree watching outside on the porch the cook got off his chair and passed into the hall that led back into the kitchen inside the sunlight shone through the empty glasses on the table john was leaning forward with his head on his arms through the window i saw two men come up the front steps they came into the drinking room one was the bearded peasant in the high boots the other was the sexton they sat down at the table under the window the girl came in and stood by their table the peasant did not seem to see her he sat with his hands on the table he wore his old army clothes there were patches on the elbows what will it be asked the sexton the peasant did not pay any attention what will you drink schnapps the peasant said and a quarter litre of red wine the sexton told the girl the girl brought the drinks and the peasant drank the schnapps he looked out of the window the sexton watched him john had his head forward on the table he was asleep the innkeeper came in and went over to the table he spoke in dialect and the sexton answered him the peasant looked out of the window the innkeeper went out of the room the peasant stood up he took a folded ten thousand kronen note out of a leather pocketbook and unfolded it the girl came up alles she asked alles he said let me buy the wine the sexton said alles the peasant repeated to the girl she put her hand in the pocket of her apron brought it out full of coins and counted out the change the peasant went out the door as soon as he was gone the innkeeper came into the room again and spoke to the sexton he sat down at the table they talked in dialect the sexton was amused the innkeeper was disgusted the sexton stood up from the table he was a little man with a mustache he leaned out of the window and looked up the road there he goes in he said in the löwen ja they talked again and then the innkeeper came over to our table the innkeeper was a tall man and old he looked at john asleep he s pretty tired yes we were up early will you want to eat soon any time i said what is there to eat anything you want the girl will bring the eating card the girl brought the menu john woke up the menu was written in ink on a card and the card slipped into a wooden paddle there s the speisekarte i said to john he looked at it he was still sleepy won t you have a drink with us i asked the innkeeper he sat down those peasants are beasts said the innkeeper we saw that one at a funeral coming into town that was his wife oh he s a beast all these peasants are beasts how do you mean you wouldn t believe it you wouldn t believe what just happened about that one tell me you wouldn t believe it the innkeeper spoke to the sexton franz come over here the sexton came bringing his little bottle of wine and his glass the gentlemen are just come down from the wiesbadenerhütte the innkeeper said we shook hands what will you drink i asked nothing franz shook his finger another quarter litre all right do you understand dialect the innkeeper asked no what s it all about john asked he s going to tell us about the peasant we saw filling the grave coming into town i can t understand it anyway john said it goes too fast for me that peasant the innkeeper said today he brought his wife in to be buried she died last november december said the sexton that makes nothing she died last december then and he notified the commune december eighteenth said the sexton anyway he couldn t bring her over to be buried until the snow was gone he lives on the other side of the paznaun said the sexton but he belongs to this parish he couldn t bring her out at all i asked no he can only come from where he lives on skis until the snow melts so today he brought her in to be buried and the priest when he looked at her face didn t want to bury her you go on and tell it he said to the sexton speak german not dialect it was very funny with the priest said the sexton in the report to the commune she died of heart trouble we knew she had heart trouble here she used to faint in church sometimes she did not come for a long time she wasn t strong to climb when the priest uncovered her face he asked olz did your wife suffer much no said olz when i came in the house she was dead across the bed the priest looked at her again he didn t like it how did her face get that way don t know olz said you d better find out the priest said and put the blanket back olz didn t say anything the priest looked at him olz looked back at the priest you want to know must know the priest said this is where it s good the innkeeper said listen to this go on franz well said olz when she died i made the report to the commune and i put her in the shed across the top of the big wood when i started to use the big wood she was stiff and i put her up against the wall her mouth was open and when i came into the shed at night to cut up the big wood i hung the lantern from it why did you do that asked the priest don t know

peasants are beasts where did he go now he s gone to drink at my colleague s the löwen he didn t want to drink with me said the sexton he didn t want to drink with me after he knew about his wife said the innkeeper say said john how about eating all right i said a pursuit race william campbell had been in a pur suit race with a burlesque show ever since pittsburgh in a pursuit race in bicycle racing riders start at equal intervals to ride after one another they ride very fast because the race is usually limited to a short distance and if they slow their riding another rider who maintains his pace will make up the space that separated them equally at the start as soon as a rider is caught and passed he is out of the race and must get down from his bicycle and leave the track if none of the riders are caught the winner of the race is the one who has gained the most distance in most pursuit races if there are only two riders one of the riders is caught inside of six miles the burlesque show caught william campbell at kansas city william campbell had hoped to hold a slight lead over the burlesque show until they reached the pacific coast as long as he preceded the burlesque show as advance man he was being paid when the burlesque show caught up with him he was in bed he was in bed when the manager of the burlesque troupe came into his room and after the manager had gone out he decided that he might as well stay in bed it was very cold in kansas city and he was in no hurry to go out he did not like kansas city he reached under the bed for a bottle and drank it made his stomach feel better mr turner the manager of the burlesque show had refused a drink william campbell s interview with mr turner had been a little strange mr turner had knocked on the door campbell

turner have a drink mr turner declined william campbell took a drink from the bottle it was a temporary measure mr turner watched him mr turner had been in this room much longer than he should have been he had many things to do although living in daily association with people who used drugs he had a horror of drugs and he was very fond of william campbell he did not wish to leave him he was very

him in the tomb next to joselito after the funeral every one sat in the cafés out of the rain and many colored pictures of maera were sold to men who rolled them up and put them away in their pockets now i lay me that night we lay on the floor in the room and i listened to the silk worms eating the silk worms fed in racks of mulberry leaves and all night you could hear them eating and a dropping sound in the leaves i myself did not want to sleep because i had been living for a long time with the knowledge that if i ever shut my eyes in the dark and let myself go my soul would go out of my body i had been that way for a long time ever since i had been blown up at night and felt it go out of me and go off and then come back i tried never to think about it but it had started to go since in the nights just at the moment of going off to sleep and i could only stop it by a very great effort so while now i am fairly sure that it would not really have gone out yet then that summer i was unwilling to make the experiment i had different ways of occupying myself while i lay awake i would think of a trout stream i had fished along when i was a boy and fish its whole length very carefully in my mind fishing very carefully under all the logs all the turns of the bank the deep holes and the clear shallow stretches sometimes catching trout and sometimes losing them i would stop fishing at noon to eat my lunch sometimes on a log over the stream sometimes on a high bank under a tree and i always ate my lunch very slowly and watched the stream below me while i ate often i ran out of bait because i would take only ten worms with me in a tobacco tin when i started when i had used them all i had to find more worms and sometimes it was very difficult digging in the bank of the stream where the cedar trees kept out the sun and there was no grass but only the bare moist earth and often i could find no worms always though i found some kind of bait but one time in the swamp i could find no bait at all and had to cut up one of the trout i had caught and use him for bait sometimes i found insects in the swamp meadows in the grass or under ferns and used them there were beetles and insects with legs like grass stems and grubs in old rotten logs white grubs with brown pinching heads that would not stay on the hook and emptied into nothing in the cold water and wood ticks under logs where sometimes i found angle worms that slipped into the ground as soon as the log was raised once i used a salamander from under an old log the salamander was very small and neat and agile and a lovely color he had tiny feet that tried to hold on to the hook and after that one time i never used a salamander although i found them very often nor did i use crickets because of the way they acted about the hook sometimes the stream ran through an open meadow and in the dry grass i would catch grasshoppers and use them for bait and sometimes i would catch grasshoppers and toss them into the stream and watch them float along swimming on the stream and circling on the surface as the current took them and then disappear as a trout rose sometimes i would fish four or five different streams in the night starting as near as i could get to their source and fishing them down stream when i had finished too quickly and the time did not go i would fish the stream over again starting where it emptied into the lake and fishing back up stream trying for all the trout i had missed coming down some nights too i made up streams and some of them were very exciting and it was like being awake and dreaming some of those streams i still remember and think that i have fished in them and they are confused with streams i really know i gave them all names and went to them on the train and sometimes walked for miles to get to them but some nights i could not fish and on those nights i was cold awake and said my prayers over and over and tried to pray for all the people i had ever known that took up a great amount of time for if you try to remember all the people you have ever known going back to the earliest thing you remember which was with me the attic of the house where i was born and my mother and father s wedding cake in a tin box hanging from one of the rafters and in the attic jars of snakes and other specimens that my father had collected as a boy and preserved in alcohol the alcohol sunken in the jars so the backs of some of the snakes and specimens were exposed and had turned white if you thought back that far you remembered a great many people if you prayed for all of them saying a hail mary and an our father for each one it took a long time and finally it would be light and then you could go to sleep if you were in a place where you could sleep in the daylight on those nights i tried to remember everything that had ever happened to me starting with just before i went to the war and remembering back from one thing to another i found i could only remember back to that attic in my grandfather s house then i would start there and remember this way again until i reached the war i remember after my grandfather died we moved away from that house and to a new house designed and built by my mother many things that were not to be moved were burned in the backyard and i remember those jars from the attic being thrown in the fire and how they popped in the heat and the fire flamed up from the alcohol i remember the snakes burning in the fire in the backyard but there were no people in that only things i could not remember who burned the things even and i would go on until i came to people and then stop and pray for them about the new house i remember how my mother was always cleaning things out and making a good clearance one time when my father was away on a hunting trip she made a good thorough cleaning out in the basement and burned everything that should not have been there when my father came home and got down from his buggy and hitched the horse the fire was still burning in the road beside the house i went out to meet him he handed me his shotgun and looked at the fire what s this he asked i ve been cleaning out the basement dear my mother said from the porch she was standing there smiling to meet him my father looked at the fire and kicked at something then he leaned over and picked something out of the ashes get a rake nick he said to me i went to the basement and brought a rake and my father raked very carefully in the ashes he raked out stone axes and stone skinning knives and tools for making arrow heads and pieces of pottery and many arrow heads they had all been blackened and chipped by the fire my father raked them all out very carefully and spread them on the grass by the road his shotgun in its leather case and his game bags were on the grass where he had left them when he stepped down from the buggy take the gun and the bags in the house nick and bring me a paper he said my mother had gone inside the house i took the shotgun which was heavy to carry and banged against my legs and the two game bags and started toward the house take them one at a time my father said don t try and carry too much at once i put down the game bags and took in the shotgun and brought out a newspaper from the pile in my father s office my father spread all the blackened chipped stone implements on the paper and then wrapped them up the best arrow heads went all to pieces he said he walked into the house with the paper package and i stayed outside on the grass with the two game bags after a while i took them in in remembering that there were only two people so i would pray for them both some nights though i could not remember my prayers even i could only get as far as on earth as it is in heaven and then have to start all over and be absolutely unable to get past that then i would have to recognize that i could not remember and give up saying my prayers that night and try something else so on some nights i would try to remember all the animals in the world by name and then the birds and then fishes and then countries and cities and then kinds of food and the names of all the streets i could remember in chicago and when i could not remember anything at all any more i would just listen and i do not remember a night on which you could not hear things if i could have a light i was not afraid to sleep because i knew my soul would only go out of me if it were dark so of course many nights i was where i could have a light and then i slept because i was nearly always tired and often very sleepy and i am sure many times too that i slept without knowing it but i never slept knowing it and on this night i listened to the silk worms you can hear silk worms eating very clearly in the night and i lay with my eyes open and listened to them there was only one other person in the room and he was awake too i listened to him being awake for a long time he could not lie as quietly as i could because perhaps he had not had as much practice being awake we were lying on blankets spread over straw and when he moved the straw was noisy but the silk worms were not frightened by any noise we made and ate on steadily there were the noises of night seven kilometres behind the lines outside but they were different from the small noises inside the room in the dark the other man in the room tried lying quietly then he moved again i moved too so he would know i was awake he had lived ten years in chicago they had taken him for a soldier in nineteen fourteen when he had come back to visit his family and they had given him me for an orderly because he spoke english i heard him listening so i moved again in the blankets can t you sleep signor tenente he asked no i can t sleep either what s the matter i don t know i can t sleep you feel all right sure i feel good i just can t sleep you want to talk a while i asked sure what can you talk about in this damn place this place is pretty good i said sure he said it s all right tell me about out in chicago i said oh he said i told you all that once tell me about how you got married i told you that was the letter you got monday from her sure she writes me all the time she s making good money with the place you ll have a nice place when you go back sure she runs it fine she s making a lot of money don t you think we ll wake them up talking i asked no they can t hear anyway they sleep like pigs i m different he said i m nervous talk quiet i said want a smoke we smoked skilfully in the dark you don t smoke much signor tenente no i ve just about cut it out well he said it don t do you any good and i suppose you get so you don t miss it did you ever hear a blind man won t smoke because he can t see the smoke come out i don t believe it i think it s all bull myself he said i just heard it somewhere you know how you hear things we were both quiet and i listened to the silk worms you hear those damn silk worms he asked you can hear them chew it s funny i said say signor tenente is there something really the matter that you can t sleep i never see you sleep you haven t slept nights ever since i been with you i don t know john i said i got in pretty bad shape along early last spring and at night it bothers me just like i am he said i shouldn t have ever got in this war i m too nervous maybe it will get better say signor tenente what did you get in this war for anyway i don t know john i wanted to then wanted to he said that s a hell of a reason we oughtn t to talk out loud i said they sleep just like pigs he said they can t understand the english language anyway they don t know a damn thing what are you going to do when it s over and we go back to the states i ll get a job on a paper in chicago maybe do you ever read what this fellow brisbane writes my wife cuts it out for me and sends it to me sure did you ever meet him no but i ve seen him i d like to meet that fellow he s a fine writer my wife don t read english but she takes the paper just like when i was home and she cuts out the editorials and the sport page and sends them to me how are your kids they re fine one of the girls is in the fourth grade now you know signor tenente if i didn t have the kids i wouldn t be your orderly now they d have made me stay in the line all the time i m glad you ve got them so am i they re fine kids but i want a boy three girls and no boy that s a hell of a note why don t you try and go to sleep no i can t sleep now i m wide awake now signor tenente say i m worried about you not sleeping though it ll be all right john imagine a young fellow like you not to sleep i ll get all right it just takes a while you got to get all right a man can t get along that don t sleep do you worry about anything you got anything on your mind no john i don t think so you ought to get married signor tenente then you wouldn t worry i don t know you ought to get married why don t you pick out some nice italian girl with plenty of money you could get any one you want you re young and you got good decorations and you look nice you been wounded a couple of times i can t talk the language well enough you talk it fine to hell with talking the language you don t have to talk to them marry them i ll think about it you know some girls don t you sure well you

married you ll never regret it every man ought to be married all right i said let s try and sleep a while all right signor tenente i ll try it again but you remember what i said i ll remember it i said now let s sleep a while john all right he said i hope you sleep signor tenente i heard him roll in his blankets on the straw and then he was very quiet and i listened to him breathing regularly then he started to snore i listened to him snore for a long time and then i stopped listening to him snore and listened to the silk worms eating they ate steadily making a dropping in the leaves i had a new thing to think about and i lay in the dark with my eyes open and thought of all the girls i had ever known and what kind of wives they would make it was a very interesting thing to think about and for a while it killed off trout fishing and interfered with my prayers finally though i went back to trout fishing because i found that i could remember all the streams and there was always something new about them while the girls after i had thought about them a few times blurred and i could not call them into my mind and finally they all blurred and all became rather the same and i gave up thinking about them almost altogether but i kept on with my prayers and i prayed very often for john in the nights and his class was removed from active service before the october offensive i was glad he was not there because he would have been a great worry to me he came to the hospital in milan to see me several months after and was very disappointed that i had not yet married and i know he would feel very badly if he knew that so far i have never married he was going back to america and he was very certain about marriage and knew it would fix up everything after the storm it wasn t about anything some thing about making punch and then we started fighting and i slipped and he had me down kneeling on my chest and choking me with both hands like he was trying to kill me and all the time i was trying to get the knife out of my pocket to cut him loose everybody was too drunk to pull him off me he was choking me and hammering my head on the floor and i got the knife out and opened it up and i cut the muscle right across his arm and he let go of me he couldn t have held on if he wanted to then he rolled and hung onto that arm and started to cry and i said what the hell you want to choke me for i d have killed him i couldn t swallow for a week he hurt my throat bad well i went out of there and there were plenty of them with him and some came out after me and i made a turn and was down by the docks and i met a fellow and he said somebody killed a man up the street i said who killed him and he said i don t know who killed him but he s dead all right and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and i got a skiff and went out and found my boat where i had her inside of mango key and she was all right only she was full of water so i bailed her out and pumped her out and there was a moon but plenty of clouds and still plenty rough and i took it down along and when it was daylight i was off eastern harbor brother that was some storm i was the first boat out and you never saw water like that was it was just as white as a lye barrel and coming from eastern harbor to sou west key you couldn t recognize the shore there was a big channel blown right out through the middle of the beach trees and all blown out and a channel cut through and all the water white as chalk and everything on it branches and whole trees and dead birds and all floating inside the keys were all the pelicans in the world and all kinds of birds flying they must have gone inside there when they knew it was coming i lay at sou west key a day and nobody came after me i was the first boat out and i seen a spar floating and i knew there must be a wreck and i started out to look for her i found her she was a three masted schooner and i could just see the stumps of her spars out of water she was in too deep water and i didn t get anything off of her so i went on looking for something else i had the start on all of them and i knew i ought to get whatever there was i went on down over the sand bars from where i left that three masted schooner and i didn t find anything and i went on a long way i was way out toward the quicksands and i didn t find anything so i went on then when i was in sight of the rebecca light i saw all kinds of birds making over something and i headed over for them to see what it was and there was a cloud of birds all right i could see something looked like a spar up out of the water and when i got over close the birds all went up in the air and stayed all around me the water was clear out there and there was a spar of some kind sticking out just above the water and when i come up close to it i saw it was all dark under water like a long shadow and i came right over it and there under water was a liner just lying there all under water as big as the whole world i drifted over her in the boat she lay on her side and the stern was deep down the port holes were all shut tight and i could see the glass shine in the water and the whole of her the biggest boat i ever saw in my life laying there and i went along the whole length of her and then i went over and anchored and i had the skiff on the deck forward and i shoved it down into the water and sculled over with the birds all around me i had a water glass like we use sponging and my hand shook so i could hardly hold it all the port holes were shut that you could see going along over her but way down below near the bottom something must have been open because there were pieces of things floating out all the time you couldn t tell what they were just pieces that s what the birds were after you never saw so many birds they were all around me crazy yelling i could see everything sharp and clear i could see her rounded over and she looked a mile long under the water she was lying on a clear white bank of sand and the spar was a sort of foremast or some sort of tackle that slanted out of water the way she was laying on her side her bow wasn t very far under i could stand on the letters of her name on her bow and my head was just out of water but the nearest port hole was twelve feet down i could just reach it with the grains pole and i tried to break it with that but i couldn t the glass was too stout so i sculled back to the boat and got a wrench and lashed it to the end of the grains pole and i couldn t break it there i was looking down through the glass at that liner with everything in her and i was the first one to her and i couldn t get into her she must have had five million dollars worth in her it made me shaky to think how much she must have in her inside the port hole that was closest i could see something but i couldn t make it out through the water glass i couldn t do any good with the grains pole and i took off my clothes and stood and took a couple of deep breaths and dove over off the stern with the wrench in my hand and swam down i could hold on for a second to the edge of the port hole and i could see in and there was a woman inside with her hair floating all out i could see her floating plain and i hit the glass twice with the wrench hard and i heard the noise clink in my ears but it wouldn t break and i had to come up i hung onto the dinghy and got my breath and then i climbed in and took a couple of breaths and dove again i swam down and took hold of the edge of the port hole with my fingers and held it and hit the glass as hard as i could with the wrench i could see the woman floated in the water through the glass her hair was tied once close to her head and it floated all out in the water i could see the rings on one of her hands she was right up close to the port hole and i hit the glass twice and i didn t even crack it when i came up i thought i wouldn t make it to the top before i d have to breathe i went down once more and i cracked the glass only cracked it and when i came up my nose was bleeding and i stood on the bow of the liner with my bare feet on the letters of her name and my head just out and rested there and then i swam over to the skiff and pulled up into it and sat there waiting for my head to stop aching and looking down into the water glass but i bled so i had to wash out the water glass then i lay back in the skiff and held my hand under my nose to stop it and i lay there with my head back looking up and there was a million birds above and all around when i quit bleeding i took another look through the glass and then i sculled over to the boat to try and find something heavier than the wrench but i couldn t find a thing not even a sponge hook i went back and the water was clearer all the time and you could see everything that floated out over that white bank of sand i looked for sharks but there weren t any you could have seen a shark a long way away the water was so clear and the sand white there was a grapple for an anchor on the skiff and i cut it off and went overboard and down with it it carried me right down and past the port hole and i grabbed and couldn t hold anything and went on down and down sliding along the curved side of her i had to let go of the grapple i heard it bump once and it seemed like a year before i came up through to the top of the water the skiff was floated away with the tide and i swam over to her with my nose bleeding in the water while i swam and i was plenty glad there weren t sharks but i was tired my head felt cracked open and i lay in the skiff and rested and then i sculled back it was getting along in the afternoon i went down once more with the wrench and it didn t do any good that wrench was too light it wasn t any good diving unless you had a big hammer or something heavy enough to do good then i lashed the wrench to the grains pole again and i watched through the water glass and pounded on the glass and hammered until the wrench came off and i saw it in the glass clear and sharp go sliding down along her and then off and down to the quicksand and go in then i couldn t do a thing the wrench was gone and i d lost the grapple so i sculled back to the boat i was too tired to get the skiff aboard and the sun was pretty low the birds were all pulling out and leaving her and i headed for sou west key towing the skiff and the birds going on ahead of me and behind me i was plenty tired that night it came on to blow and it blew for a week you couldn t get out to her they come out from town and told me the fellow i d had to cut was all right except for his arm and i went back to town and they put me under five hundred dollar bond it came out all right because some of them friends of mine swore he was after me with an ax but by the time we got back out to her the greeks had blown her open and cleaned her out they got the safe out with dynamite nobody ever knows how much they got she carried gold and they got it all they stripped her clean i found her and i never got a nickel out of her it was a hell of a thing all right they say she was just outside of havana harbor when the hurricane hit and she couldn t get in or the owners wouldn t let the captain chance coming in they say he wanted to try so she had to go with it and in the dark they were running with it trying to go through the gulf between rebecca and tortugas when she struck on the quicksands maybe her rudder was carried away maybe they weren t even steering but anyway they couldn t have known they were quicksands and when she struck the captain must have ordered them to open up the ballast tanks so she d lay solid but it was quicksand she d hit and when they opened the tank she went in stern first and then over on her beam ends there were four hundred and fifty passengers and the crew on board of her and they must all have been aboard of her when i found her they must have opened the tanks as soon as she struck and the minute she settled on it the quicksands took her down then her boilers must have burst and that must have been what made those pieces that came out it was funny there weren t any sharks though there wasn t a fish i could have seen them on that clear white sand plenty of fish now though jewfish the biggest kind the biggest part of her s under the sand now but they live inside of her the biggest kind of jewfish some weigh three to four hundred pounds sometime we ll go out and get some you can see the rebecca light from where she is they ve got a buoy on her now she s right at the end of the quicksand right at the edge of the gulf she only missed going through by about a hundred yards in the dark in the storm they just missed it raining the way it was they couldn t have seen the rebecca then they re not used to that sort of thing the captain of a liner isn t used to scudding that way they have a course and they tell me they set some sort of a compass and it steers itself they probably didn t know where they were when they ran with that blow but they come close to making it maybe they d lost the rudder though anyway there wasn t another thing for them to hit till they d get to mexico once they were in that gulf must have been something though when they struck in that rain and wind and he told them to open her tanks nobody could have been on deck in that blow and rain everybody must have been below they couldn t have lived on deck there must have been some scenes inside all right because you know she settled fast i saw that wrench go into the sand the captain couldn t have known it was quicksand when she struck unless he knew these waters he just knew it wasn t rock he must have seen it all up in the bridge he must have known what it was about when she settled i wonder how fast she made it i wonder if the mate was there with him do you think they stayed inside the bridge or do you think they took it outside they never found any bodies not a one nobody floating they float a long way with life belts too they must have took it inside well the greeks got it all everything they must have come fast all right they picked her clean first there was the birds then me then the greeks and even the birds got more out of her than i did a clean well lighted place it was late and every one had left the café except an old man who sat in the shadow the leaves of the tree made against the electric light in the day time the street was dusty but at night the dew settled the dust and the old man liked to sit late because he was deaf and now at night it was quiet and he felt the difference the two waiters inside the café knew that the old man was a little drunk and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he would leave without paying so they kept watch on him last week he tried to commit suicide one waiter said why he was in despair what about nothing how do you know it was nothing he has plenty of money they sat together at a table that was close against the wall near the door of the café and looked at the terrace where the tables were all empty except where the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the wind a girl and a soldier went by in the street the street light shone on the brass number on his collar the girl wore no head covering and hurried beside him the guard will pick him up one waiter said what does it matter if he gets what he s after he had better get off the street now the guard will get him they went by five minutes ago the old man sitting in the shadow rapped on his saucer with his glass the younger waiter went over to him what do you want the old man looked at him another brandy he said you ll be drunk the waiter said the old man looked at him the waiter went away he ll stay all night he said to his colleague i m sleepy now i never get into bed before three o clock he should have killed himself last week the waiter took the brandy bottle and another saucer from the counter inside the café and marched out to the old man s table he put down the saucer and poured the glass full of brandy you should have killed yourself last week he said to the deaf man the old man motioned with his finger a little more he said the waiter poured on into the glass so that the brandy slopped over and ran down the stem into the top saucer of the pile thank you the old man said the waiter took the bottle back inside the café he sat down at the table with his colleague again he s drunk now he said he s drunk every night what did he want to kill himself for how should i know how did he do it he hung himself with a rope who cut him down his niece why did they do it fear for his soul how much money has he got he s got plenty he must be eighty years old anyway i should say he was eighty i wish he would go home i never get to bed before three o clock what kind of hour is that to go to bed he stays up because he likes it he s lonely i m not lonely i have a wife waiting in bed for me he had a wife once too a wife would be no good to him now you can t tell he might be better with a wife his niece looks after him you said she cut him down i know i wouldn t want to be that old an old man is a nasty thing not always this old man is clean he drinks without spilling even now drunk look at him i don t want to look at him i wish he would go home he has no regard for those who must work the old man looked from his glass across the square then over at the waiters another brandy he said pointing to his glass the waiter who was in a hurry came over finished he said speaking with that omission of syntax stupid people employ when talking to drunken people or foreigners no more tonight close now another said the old man no finished the waiter wiped the edge of the table with a towel and shook his head the old man stood up slowly counted the saucers took a leather coin purse from his pocket and paid for the drinks leaving half a peseta tip the waiter watched him go down the street a very old man walking unsteadily but with dignity why didn t you let him stay and drink the unhurried waiter asked they were putting up the shutters it is not half past two i want to go home to bed what is an hour more to me than to him an hour is the same you talk like an old man yourself he can buy a bottle and drink at home it s not the same no it is not agreed the waiter with a wife he did not wish to be unjust he was only in a hurry and you you have no fear of going home before your usual hour are you trying to insult me no hombre only to make a joke no the waiter who was in a hurry said rising from pulling down the metal shutters i have confidence i am all confidence you have youth confidence and a job the older waiter said you have everything and what do you lack everything but work you have everything i have no i have never had confidence and i am not young come on stop talking nonsense and lock up i am of those who like to stay late at the café the older waiter said with all those who do not want to go to bed with all those who need a light for the night i want to go home and into bed we are of two different kinds the older waiter said he was now dressed to go home it is not only a question of youth and confidence although those things are very beautiful each night i am reluctant to close up because there may be some one who needs the café hombre there are bodegas open all night long you do not understand this is a clean and pleasant café it is well lighted the light is very good and also now there are shadows of the leaves good night said the younger waiter good night the other said turning off the electric light he continued the conversation with himself it is the light of course but it is necessary that the place be clean and pleasant you do not want music certainly you do not want music nor can you stand before a bar with dignity although that is all that is provided for these hours what did he fear it was not fear or dread it was a nothing that he knew too well it was all a nothing and a man was nothing too it was only that and light was all it needed and a certain cleanness and order some lived in it and never felt it but he knew it all was nada y pues nada y nada y pues nada our nada who art in nada nada be thy name thy kingdom nada thy will be nada in nada as it is in nada give us this nada our daily nada and nada us our nada as we nada our nadas and nada us not into nada but deliver us from nada pues nada hail nothing full of nothing nothing is with thee he smiled and stood before a bar with a shining steam pressure coffee machine what s yours asked the barman nada otro loco m ás said the barman and turned away a little cup said the waiter the barman poured it for him the light is very bright and pleasant but the bar is unpolished the waiter said the barman looked at him but did not answer it was too late at night for conversation you want another copita the barman asked no thank you said the waiter and went out he disliked bars and bodegas a clean welllighted café was a very different thing now without thinking further he would go home to his room he would lie in the bed and finally with daylight he would go to sleep after all he said to himself it is probably only insomnia many must have it the light of the world when he saw us come in the door the bartender looked up and then reached over and put the glass covers on the two free lunch bowls give me a beer i said he drew it cut the top off with the spatula and then held the glass in his hand i put the nickel on the wood and he slid the beer toward me what s yours he said to tom beer he drew that beer and cut it off and when he saw the money he pushed the beer across to tom what s the matter tom asked the bartender didn t answer him he just looked over our heads and said what s yours to a man who d come in rye the man said the bartender put out the bottle and glass and a glass of water tom reached over and took the glass off the free lunch bowl it was a bowl of pickled pig s feet and there was a wooden thing that worked like a scissors with two wooden forks at the end to pick them up with no said the bartender and put the glass cover back on the bowl tom held the wooden scissors fork in his hand put it back said the bartender you know where said tom the bartender reached a hand forward under the bar watching us both i put fifty cents on the wood and he straightened up what was yours he said beer i said and before he drew the beer he uncovered both the bowls your goddam pig s feet stink tom said and spit what he had in his mouth on the floor the bartender didn t say anything the man who had drunk the rye paid and went out without looking back you stink yourself the bartender said all you punks stink he says we re punks tommy said to me listen i said let s get out you punks clear the hell out of here the bartender said i said we were going out i said it wasn t your idea we ll be back tommy said no you won t the bartender told him tell him

one end and we were going out the other it smelled of hides and tan bark and the big piles of sawdust it was getting dark as we came in and now that it was dark it was cold and the puddles of water in the road were freezing at the edges down at the station there were five whores waiting for the train to come in and six white men and four indians it was crowded and hot from the stove and full of stale smoke as we came in nobody was talking and the ticket window was down shut the door can t you somebody said i looked to see who said it it was one of the white men he wore slagged trousers and lumbermen s rubbers and a mackinaw shirt like the others but he had no cap and his face was white and his hands were white and thin aren t you going to shut it sure i said and shut it thank you he

flesh she just keep on laughing and shaking oh my christ she said she had a nice voice oh my sweet christ the two other whores the big ones acted very quiet and placid as though they didn t have much sense but they were big nearly as big as the biggest one they d have both gone well over two hundred and fifty pounds the other two were dignified of the men besides the cook and the one who talked there were two other lumberjacks one that listened interested but bashful and the other that seemed getting ready to say something and two swedes two indians were sitting down at the end of the bench and one standing up against the wall the man who was getting ready to say something spoke to me very low must be like getting on top of a hay mow i laughed and said it to tommy i swear to christ i ve

said come on let s go good bye said alice she certainly had a nice voice good bye i said which way are you boys going asked the cook the other way from you tom told him god rest you merry gentlemen in those days the distances were all very different the dirt blew off the hills that now have been cut down and kansas city was very like constantinople you may not believe this no one believes this but it is true on this afternoon it was snowing and inside an automobile dealer s show window lighted against the early dark there was a racing motor car finished entirely in silver with dans argent lettered on the hood this i believed to mean the silver dance or the silver dancer and slightly puzzled which it meant but happy in the sight of the car and pleased by my knowledge of a foreign language i went along the street in the snow i was walking from the woolf brothers saloon where on christmas and thanksgiving day a free turkey dinner was served toward the city hospital which was on a high hill that overlooked the smoke the buildings and the streets of the town in the reception room of the hospital were the two ambulance surgeons doc fischer and doctor wilcox sitting the one before a desk the other in a chair against the wall doc fischer was thin sand blond with a thin mouth amused eyes and gambler s hands doctor wilcox was short dark and carried an indexed book the young doctor s friend and guide which being consulted on any given subject told symptoms and treatment it was also cross indexed so that being consulted on symptoms it gave diagnoses doc fischer had suggested that any future editions should be further cross indexed so that if consulted as to the treatments being given it would reveal ailments and symptoms as an aid to memory he said doctor wilcox was sensitive about this book but could not get along without it it was bound in limp leather and fitted his coat pocket and he had bought it at the advice of one of his professors who had said wilcox you have no business being a physician and i have done everything in my power to prevent you from being certified as one since you are now a member of this learned profession i advise you in the name of humanity to obtain a copy of the young doctor s friend and guide and use it doctor wilcox learn to use it doctor wilcox had said nothing but he had bought the leather bound guide that same day well horace doc fischer said as i came in the receiving room which smelt of cigarettes iodoform carbolic and an overheated radiator gentlemen i said what news along the rialto doc fischer asked he affected a certain extravagance of speech which seemed to me to be of the utmost elegance the free turkey at woolf s i answered you partook copiously many of the confrères present all of them the whole staff much yuletide cheer not much doctor wilcox here has partaken slightly doc fischer said doctor wilcox looked up at him then at me want a drink he asked no thanks i said that s all right doctor wilcox said horace doc fischer said you don t mind me calling you horace do you no good old horace we ve had an extremely interesting case i ll say said doctor wilcox you know the lad who was in here yesterday which one the lad who sought eunuch hood yes i had been there when he came in he was a boy about sixteen he came in with no hat on and was very excited and frightened but determined he was curly haired and well built and his lips were prominent what s the matter with you son doctor wilcox asked him i want to be castrated the boy said why doc fischer asked i ve prayed and i ve done everything and nothing helps helps what that awful lust what awful lust the way i get the way i can t stop getting i pray all night about it just what happens doc fischer asked the boy told him listen boy doc fischer said there s nothing wrong with you that s the way you re supposed to be there s nothing wrong with that it is wrong said the boy it s a sin against purity it s a sin against our lord and saviour no said doc fisher it s a natural thing it s the way you are supposed to be and later on you will think you are very fortunate oh you don t understand the boy said listen doc fischer said and he told the boy certain things no i won t listen you can t make me listen please listen doc fischer said you re just a goddamned fool doctor wilcox said to the boy then you won t do it the boy asked do what castrate me listen doc fischer said no one will castrate you there is nothing wrong with your body you have a fine body and you must not think about that if you are religious remember that what you complain of is no sinful state but the means of consummating a sacrament i can t stop it happening the boy said i pray all night and i pray in the daytime it is a sin a constant sin against purity oh go and doctor wilcox said when you talk like that i don t hear you the boy said with dignity to doctor wilcox won t you please do it he asked doc fischer no said doc fischer i ve told you boy get him out of here doctor wilcox said i ll get out the boy said don t touch me i ll get out that was about five o clock on the day before so what happened i asked so at one o clock this morning doc fischer said we receive the youth self mutilated with a razor castrated no said doc fisher he didn t know what castrate meant he may die doctor wilcox said why loss of blood the good physician here doctor wilcox my colleague was on call and he was unable to find this emergency listed in his book the hell with you talking that way doctor wilcox said i only mean it in the friendliest way doctor doc fischer said looking at his hands at his hands that had with his willingness to oblige and his lack of respect for federal statutes made him his trouble horace here will bear me out that i only speak of it in the very friendliest way it was an amputation the young man performed horace well i wish you wouldn t ride me about it doctor wilcox said there isn t any need to ride me ride you doctor on the day the very anniversary of our saviour s birth our saviour ain t you a jew doctor wilcox said so i am so i am it always is slipping my mind i ve never given it its proper importance so good of you to remind me your saviour that s right your saviour undoubtedly your saviour and the ride for palm sunday you re too damned smart doctor wilcox said an excellent diagnosis doctor i was always too damned smart too damned smart on the coast certainly avoid it horace you haven t much tendency but sometimes i see a gleam but what a diagnosis and without the book the hell with you doctor wilcox said all in good time doctor doc fischer said all in good time if there is such a place i shall certainly visit it i have even had a very small look into it no more than a peek really i looked away almost at once and do you know what the young man said horace when the good doctor here brought him in he said oh i asked you to do it i asked you so many times to do it on christmas day too doctor wilcox said the significance of the particular day is not important doc fischer said maybe not to you said doctor wilcox you hear him horace doc fischer said you hear him having discovered my vulnerable point my achilles tendon so to speak the doctor pursues his advantage you re too damned smart doctor wilcox said the sea change all right said the man what about it no said the girl i can t you mean you won t i can t said the girl that s all that i mean you mean that you won t all right said the girl you have it your own way i don t have it my own way i wish to god i did you did for a long time the girl said it was early and there was no one in the café except the barman and these two who sat together at a table in the corner it was the end of the summer and they were both tanned so that they looked out of place in paris the girl wore a tweed suit her skin was a smooth golden brown her blonde hair was cut short and grew beautifully away from her forehead the man looked at her i ll kill her he said please don t the girl said she had very fine hands and the man looked at them they were slim and brown and very beautiful i will i swear to god i will it won t make you happy couldn t you have gotten into something else couldn t you have gotten into some other jam it seems not the girl said what are you going to do about it i told you no i mean really i don t know he said she looked at him and put out her hand poor old phil she said he looked at her hands but he did not touch her hand with his no thanks he said it doesn t do any good to say i m sorry no nor to tell you how it is i d rather not hear i love you very much yes this proves it i m sorry she said if you don t understand i understand that s the trouble i understand you do she said that makes it worse of course sure he said looking at her i ll understand all the time all day and all night especially all night i ll understand you don t have to worry about that i m sorry she said if it was a man don t say that it wouldn t be a man you know that don t you trust me that s funny he said trust you that s really funny i m sorry she said that s all i seem to say but when we do

polite you re a funny girl you re not you re a fine man and it breaks my heart to go off and leave you you have to of course yes she said i have to and you know it he did not say anything and she looked at him and put her hand out again the barman was at the far end of the bar his face was white and so was his jacket he knew these two and thought them a handsome young couple he had seen many handsome young couples break up and new couples form that were never so handsome long he was not thinking about this but about a horse in half an hour he could send across the street to find if the horse had won couldn t you just be good to me and let me go the girl asked what do you think i m going to do two people came in the door and went up to the bar yes sir the barman took the orders you can t forgive me when you know about it the girl asked no you don t think things we ve had and done should make any difference in understanding vice is a monster of such fearful mien the young man said bitterly that to be something or other needs but to be seen then we something something then embrace he could not remember the words i can t quote he said let s not say vice she said that s not very polite perversion he said james one of the clients addressed the barman you re looking very well you re looking very well yourself the barman said old james the other client said you re fatter james it s terrible the barman said the way i put it on don t neglect to insert the brandy james the first client said no sir said the barman trust me the two at the bar looked over at the two at the table then looked back at the barman again towards the barman was the comfortable direction i d like it better if you didn t use words like that the girl said there s no necessity to use a word like that what do you want me to call it you don t have to call it you don t have to put any name to it that s the name for it no she said we re made up of all sorts of things you ve known that you ve used it well enough you don t have to say that again because that explains it to you all right he said all right you mean all wrong i know it s all wrong but i ll come back i told you i d come back i ll come back right away no you won t i ll come back no you won t not to me you ll see yes he said that s the hell of it you probably will of course i will go on then really she could not believe him but her voice was happy go on his voice sounded strange to him he was looking at her at the way her mouth went and the curve of her cheek bones at her eyes and at the way her hair grew on her forehead and at the edge of her ear and at her neck not really oh you re too sweet she said you re too good to me and when you come back tell me all about it his voice sounded very strange he did not recognize it she looked at him quickly he was settled into something you want me to go she asked seriously yes he said seriously right away his voice was not the same and his mouth was very dry now he said she stood up and went out quickly she did not look back at him he watched her go he was not the same looking man as he had been before he had told her to go he got up from the table picked up the two checks and went over to the bar with them i m a different man james he said to the barman you see in me quite a different man yes sir said james vice said the brown young man is a very strange thing james he looked out the door he saw her going down the street as he looked in the glass he saw he was really quite a differentlooking man the other two at the bar moved down to make room for him you re right there sir james said the other two moved down a little more so that he would be quite comfortable the young man saw himself in the mirror behind the bar i said i was a different man james he said looking into the mirror he saw that this was quite true you look very well sir james said you must have had a very good summer a way you ll never be the attack had gone across the field been held up by machine gun fire from the sunken road and from the group of farm houses encountered no resistance in the town and reached the bank of the river coming along the road on a bicycle getting off to push the machine when the surface of the road became too broken nicholas adams saw what had happened by the position of the dead they lay alone or in clumps in the high grass of the field and along the road their pockets out and over them were flies and around each body or group of bodies were the scattered papers in the grass and the grain beside the road and in some places scattered over the road there was much material a field kitchen it must have come over when things were going well many of the calfskin covered haversacks stick bombs helmets rifles sometimes one butt up the bayonet stuck in the dirt they had dug quite a little at the last stick bombs helmets rifles intrenching tools ammunition boxes star shell pistols their shells scattered about medical kits gas masks empty gas mask cans a squat tripodded machine gun in a nest of empty shells full belts protruding from the boxes the watercooling can empty and on its side the breech block gone the crew in odd positions and around them in the grass more of the typical papers there were mass prayer books group postcards showing the machine gun unit standing in ranked and ruddy cheerfulness as in a football picture for a college annual now they were humped and swollen in the grass propaganda postcards showing a soldier in austrian uniform bending a woman backward over a bed the figures were impressionistically drawn very attractively depicted and had nothing in common with actual rape in which the woman s skirts are pulled over her head to smother her one comrade sometimes sitting upon the head there were many of these inciting cards which had evidently been issued just before the offensive now they were scattered with the smutty postcards photographic the small photographs of village girls by village photographers the occasional pictures of children and the letters letters letters there was always much paper about the dead and the débris of this attack was no exception these were new dead and no one had bothered with anything but their pockets our own dead or what he thought of still as our own dead were surprisingly few nick noticed their coats had been opened too and their pockets were out and they showed by their positions the manner and the skill of the attack the hot weather had swollen them all alike regardless of nationality the town had evidently been defended at the last from the line of the sunken road and there had been few or no austrians to fall back into it there were only three bodies in the street and they looked to have been killed running the houses of the town were broken by the shelling and the street had much rubble of plaster and mortar and there were broken beams broken tiles and many holes some of them yellow edged from the mustard gas there were many pieces of shell and shrapnel balls were scattered in the rubble there was no one in the town at all nick adams had seen no one since he had left fornaci although riding along the road through the over foliaged country he had seen guns hidden under screens of mulberry leaves to the left of the road noticing them by the heat waves in the air above the leaves where the sun hit the metal now he went on through the town surprised to find it deserted and came out on the low road beneath the bank of the river leaving the town there was a bare open space where the road slanted down and he could see the placid reach of the river and the low curve of the opposite bank and the whitened sun baked mud where the austrians had dug it was all very lush and over green since he had seen it last and becoming historical had made no change in this the lower river the battalion was along the bank to the left there was a series of holes in the top of the bank with a few men in them nick noticed where the machine guns were posted and the signal rockets in their racks the men in the holes in the side of the bank were sleeping no one challenged he went on and as he came around a turn in the mud bank a young second lieutenant with a stubble of beard and red rimmed very blood shot eyes pointed a pistol at him who are you nick told him how do i know this nick showed him the tessera with photograph and identification and the seal of the third army he took hold of it i will keep this you will not nick said give me back the card and put your gun away there in the holster how am i to know who you are the tessera tells you and if the tessera is false give me that card don t be a fool nick said cheerfully take me to your company commander i should send you to battalion headquarters all right said nick listen do you know the captain paravicini the tall one with the small mustache who was an architect and speaks english you know him a little what company does he command the second he is commanding the battalion good said nick he was relieved to know that para was all right let us go to the battalion as nick had left the edge of the town three shrapnel had burst high and to the right over one of the wrecked houses and since then there had been no shelling but the face of this officer looked like the face of a man during a bombardment there was the same tightness and the voice did not sound natural his pistol made nick nervous put it away he said there s the whole river between them and you if i thought you were a spy i would shoot you now the second lieutenant said come on said nick let us go to the battalion this officer made him very nervous the captain paravicini acting major thinner and more english looking than ever rose when nick saluted from behind the table in the dugout that was battalion headquarters hello he said i didn t know you what are you doing in that uniform they ve put me in it i am very glad to see you nicolo right you look well how was the show we made a very fine attack truly a very fine attack i will show you look he showed on the map how the attack had gone i came from fornaci nick said i could see how it had been it was very good it was extraordinary altogether extraordinary are you attached to the regiment no i am supposed to move around and let them see the uniform how odd if they see one american uniform that is supposed to make them believe others are coming but how will they know it is an american uniform you will tell them oh yes i see i will send a corporal with you to show you about and you will make a tour of the lines like a bloody politician nick said you would be much more distinguished in civilian clothes they are what is really distinguished with a homburg hat said nick or with a very furry fedora i m supposed to have my pockets full of cigarettes and postal cards and such things nick said i should have a musette full of chocolate these i should distribute with a kind word and a pat on the back but there weren t any cigarettes and postcards and no chocolate so they said to circulate around anyway i m sure your appearance will be very heartening to the troops i wish you wouldn t nick said i feel badly enough about it as it is in principle i would have brought you a bottle of brandy in principle para said and smiled for the first time showing yellowed teeth such a beautiful expression would you like some grappa no thank you nick said it hasn t any ether in it i can taste that still nick remembered suddenly and completely you know i never knew you were drunk until you started talking coming back in the camions i was stinking in every attack nick said i can t do it para said i took it in the first show the very first show and it only made me very upset and then frightfully thirsty you don t need it you re much braver in an attack than i am no nick said i know how i am and i prefer to get stinking i m not ashamed of it i ve never seen you drunk no said nick never not when we rode from mestre to portogrande that night and i wanted to go to sleep and used the bicycle for a blanket and pulled it up under my chin that wasn t in the lines let s not talk about how i am nick said it s a subject i know too much about to want to think about it any more you might as well stay here a while paravicini said you can take a nap if you like they didn t do much to this in the bombardment it s too hot to go out yet i suppose there is no hurry how are you really i m fine i m perfectly all right no i mean really i m all right i can t sleep without a light of some sort that s all i have now i said it should have been trepanned i m no doctor but i know that well they thought it was better to have it absorb and that s what i got what s the matter i don t seem crazy to you do i you seem in top hole shape it s a hell of a nuisance once they ve had you certified as nutty nick said no one ever has any confidence in you again i would take a nap nicolo paravicini said this isn t battalion headquarters as we used to know it we re just waiting to be pulled out you oughtn t to go out in the heat now it s silly use that bunk i might just lie down nick said nick lay on the bunk he was very disappointed that he felt this way and more disappointed even that it was so obvious to captain paravicini this was not as large a dugout as the one where that platoon of the class of 1899 just out at the front got hysterics during the bombardment before the attack and para had had him walk them two at a time outside to show them nothing would happen he wearing his own chin strap tight across his mouth to keep his lips quiet knowing they could not hold it when they took it knowing it was all a bloody balls if he can t stop crying break his nose to give him something else to think about i d shoot one but it s too late now they d all be worse break his nose they ve put it back to five twenty we ve only got four minutes more break that other silly bugger s nose and kick his silly ass out of here do you think they ll go over if they don t shoot two and try to scoop the others out some way keep behind them sergeant it s no use to walk ahead and find there s nothing coming behind you bail them out as you go what a bloody balls all right that s right then looking at the watch in that quiet tone that valuable quiet tone savoia making it cold no time to get it he couldn t find his own after the cave in one whole end had caved in it was that started them making it cold up that slope the only time he hadn t done it stinking and after they came back the teleferica house burned it seemed and some of the wounded got down four days later and some did not get down but we went up and we went back and we came down we always came down and there was gaby delys oddly enough with feathers on you called me baby doll a year ago tadada you said that i was rather nice to know tadada with feathers on with feathers off the great gaby and my name s harry pilcer too we used to step out of the far side of the taxis when it got steep going up the hill and he could see that hill every night when he dreamed with sacré coeur blown white like a soap bubble sometimes his girl was there and sometimes she was with some one else and he could not understand that but those were the nights the river ran so much wider and stiller than it should and outside of fossalta there was a low house painted yellow with willows all around it and a low stable and there was a canal and he had been there a thousand times and never seen it but there it was every night as plain as the hill only it frightened him that house meant more than anything and every night he had it that was what he needed but it frightened him especially when the boat lay there quietly in the willows on the canal but the banks weren t like this river it was all lower as it was at portogrande where they had seen them come wallowing across the flooded ground holding the rifles high until they fell with them in the water who ordered that one if it didn t get so damned mixed up he could follow it all right that was why he noticed everything in such detail to keep it all straight so he would know just where he was but suddenly it confused without reason as now he lying in a bunk at battalion headquarters with para commanding a battalion and he in a bloody american uniform he sat up and looked around they all watching him para was gone out he lay down again the paris part came earlier and he was not frightened of it except when she had gone off with some one else and the fear that they might take the same driver twice that was what frightened about that never about the front he never dreamed about the front now any more but what frightened him so that he could not get rid of it was that long yellow house and the different width of the river now he was back here at the river he had gone through that same town and there was no house nor was the river that way then where did he go each night and what was the peril and why would he wake soaking wet more frightened than he had ever been in a bombardment because of a house and a long stable and a canal he sat up swung his legs carefully down they stiffened any time they were out straight for long returned the stares of the adjutant the signallers and the two runners by the door and put on his clothcovered trench helmet i regret the absence of the chocolate the postal cards and cigarettes he said i am however wearing the uniform the major is coming back at once the adjutant said in that army an adjutant is not a commissioned officer the uniform is not very correct nick told them but it gives you the idea there will be several millions of americans here shortly do you think they will send americans down here asked the adjutant oh absolutely americans twice as large as myself healthy with clean hearts sleep at night never been wounded never been blown up never had their heads caved in never been scared don t drink faithful to the girls they left behind them many of them never had crabs wonderful chaps you ll see are you an italian asked the adjutant no american look at the uniform spagnolini made it but it s not quite correct a north or south american north said nick he felt it coming on now he would quiet down but you speak italian why not do you mind if i speak italian haven t i a right to speak italian you have italian medals just the ribbons and the papers the medals come later or you give them to people to keep and the people go away or they are lost with your baggage you can purchase others in milan it is the papers that are of importance you must not feel badly about them you will have some yourself if you stay at the front long enough i am a veteran of the eritrea campaign said the adjutant stiffly i fought in tripoli it s quite something to have met you nick put out his hand those must have been trying days i noticed the ribbons were you by any chance on the carso i have just been called up for this war my class was too old at one time i was under the age limit nick said but now i am reformed out of the war but why are you here now i am demonstrating the american uniform nick said don t you think it is very significant it is a little tight in the collar but soon you will see untold millions wearing this uniform swarming like locusts the grasshopper you know what we call the grasshopper in america is really a locust the true grasshopper is small and green and comparatively feeble you must not however make a confusion with the seven year locust or cicada which emits a peculiar sustained sound which at the moment i cannot recall i try to recall it but i cannot i can almost hear it and then it is quite gone you will pardon me if i break off our conversation see if you can find the major the adjutant said to one of the two runners i can see you have been wounded he said to nick in various places nick said if you are interested in scars i can show you some very interesting ones but i would rather talk about grasshoppers what we call grasshoppers that is and what are really locusts these insects at one time played a very important part in my life it might interest you and you can look at the uniform while i am talking the adjutant made a motion with his hand to the second runner who went out fix your eyes on the uniform spagnolini made it you know you might as well look too nick said to the signallers i really have no rank we re under the american consul it s perfectly all right for you to look you can stare if you like i will tell you about the american locust we always preferred one that we called the medium brown they last the best in the water and fish prefer them the larger ones that fly making a noise somewhat similar to that produced by a rattlesnake rattling his rattlers a very dry sound have vivid colored wings some are bright red others yellow barred with black but their wings go to pieces in the water and they make a very blowsy bait while the mediumbrown is a plump compact succulent hopper that i can recommend as far as one may well recommend something you gentlemen will probably never encounter but i must insist that you will never gather a sufficient supply of these insects for a day s fishing by pursuing them with your hands or trying to hit them with a bat that is sheer nonsense and a useless waste of time i repeat gentlemen that you will get nowhere at it the correct procedure and one which should be taught all young officers at every small arms course if i had anything to say about it and who knows but what i will have is the employment of a seine or net made of common mosquito netting two officers holding this length of netting at alternate ends or let us say one at each end stoop hold the bottom extremity of the net in one hand and the top extremity in the other and run into the wind the hoppers flying with the wind fly against the length of netting and are imprisoned in its folds it is no trick at all to catch a very great quantity indeed and no officer in my opinion should be without a length of mosquito netting suitable for the improvisation of one of these grasshopper seines i hope i have made myself clear gentlemen are there any questions if there is anything in the course you do not understand please ask questions speak up none then i would like to close on this note in the words of that great soldier and gentleman sir henry wilson gentlemen either you must govern or you must be governed let me repeat it gentlemen there is one thing i would like to have you remember one thing i would like you to take with you as you leave this room gentlemen either you must govern or you must be governed that is all gentlemen good day he removed his cloth covered helmet put it on again and stooping went out the low entrance of the dugout para accompanied by the two runners was coming down the line of the sunken road it was very hot in the sun and nick removed the helmet there ought to be a system for wetting these things he said i shall wet this one in the river he started up the bank nicolo paravicini called nicolo where are you going i don t really have to go nick came down the slope holding the helmet in his hands they re a damned nuisance wet or dry do you wear yours all the time all the time said para it s making me bald come inside inside para told him to sit down you know they re absolutely no damned good nick said i remember when they were a comfort when we first had them but i ve seen them full of brains too many times nicolo para said i think you should go back i think it would be better if you didn t come up to the line until you had those supplies there s nothing here for you to do if you move around even with something worth giving away the men will group and that invites shelling i won t have it i know it s silly nick said it wasn t my idea i heard the brigade was here so i thought i would see you or some one else i knew i could have gone to zenzon or to san dona i d like to go to san dona to see the bridge again i won t have you circulating around to no purpose captain paravicini said all right said nick he felt it coming on again you understand of course said nick he was trying to hold it in anything of that sort should be done at night naturally said nick he knew he could not stop it now you see i am commanding the battalion para said and why shouldn t you be nick said here it came you can read and write can t you yes said para gently the trouble is you have a damned small battalion to command as soon as it gets to strength again they ll give you back your company why don t they bury the dead i ve seen them now i don t care about seeing them again they can bury them any time as far as i m concerned and it would be much better for you you ll all get bloody sick where did you leave your bicycle inside the last house do you think it will be all right don t worry nick said i ll go in a little while lie down a little while nicolo all right he shut his eyes and in place of the man with the beard who looked at him over the sights of the rifle quite calmly before squeezing off the white flash and clublike impact on his knees hot sweet choking coughing it onto the rock while they went past him he saw a long yellow house with a low stable and the river much wider than it was and stiller christ he said i might as well go he stood up i m going para he said i ll ride back now in the afternoon if any supplies have come i ll bring them down tonight if not i ll come at night when i have something to bring it is still hot to ride captain paravicini said you don t need to worry nick said i m all right now for quite a while i had one then but it was easy they re getting much better i can tell when i m going to have one because i talk so much i ll send a runner with you i d rather you didn t i know the way you ll be back soon absolutely let me send no said nick as a mark of confidence well ciao then ciao said nick he started back along the sunken road toward where he had left the bicycle in the afternoon the road would be shady once he had passed the canal beyond that there were trees on both sides that had not been shelled at all it was on that stretch that marching they had once passed the terza savoia cavalry regiment riding in the snow with their lances the horses breath made plumes in the cold air no that was somewhere else where was that i d b e tt e r g e t t o tha t d a mne d b i c yc l e n i c k s a i d t o hi ms e l f i d o n t w a nt t o l o s e the w a y t o f o r na c i the mother of a queen when his father died he was only a kid and his manager buried him perpetually that is so he would have the plot permanently but when his mother died his manager thought they might not always be so hot on each other they were sweethearts sure he s a queen didn t you know that of course he is so he just buried her for five years well when he came back to mexico from spain he got the first notice it said it was the first notice that the five years were up and would he make arrangements for the continuing of his mother s grave it was only twenty dollars for perpetual i had the cash box then and i said let me attend to it paco but he said no he would look after it he d look after it right away it was his mother and he wanted to do it himself then in a week he got the second notice i read it to him and i said i thought he had looked after it no he said he hadn t let me do it i said it s right here in the cash box no he said nobody could tell him what to do he d do it himself when he got around to it what s the sense in spending money sooner than necessary all right i said but see you look after it at this time he had a contract for six fights at four thousand pesos a fight besides his benefit fight he made over fifteen thousand dollars there in the capital alone he was just tight that s all the third notice came in another week and i read it to him it said that if he did not make the payment by the following saturday his mother s grave would be opened and her remains dumped on the common boneheap he said he would go attend to it that afternoon when he went to town why not have me do it i asked him keep out of my business he said it s my business and i m going to do it all right if that s the way you feel about it i said do your own business he got the money out of the cash box although then he always carried a hundred or more pesos with him all the time and he said he would look after it he went out with the money and so of course i thought he had attended to it a week later the notice came that they had no response to the final warning and so his mother s body had been dumped on the boneheap on the public boneheap jesus christ i said to him you said you d pay that and you took money out of the cash box to do it and now what s happened to your mother my god think of it the public boneheap and your own mother why didn t you let me look after it i would have sent it when the first notice came it s none of your business it s my mother it s none of my business yes but it was your business what kind of blood is it in a man that will let that be done to his mother you don t deserve to have a mother it is my mother he said now she is so much dearer to me now i don t have to think of her buried in one place and be sad now she is all about me in the air like the birds and the flowers now she will always be with me jesus christ i said what kind of blood have you anyway i don t want you to even speak to me she is all around me he said now i will never be sad at that time he was spending all kinds of money around women trying to make himself seem a man and fool people but it didn t have any effect on people that knew anything about him he owed me over six hundred pesos and he wouldn t pay me why do you want it now he d say don t you trust me aren t we friends it isn t friends or trusting you it s that i paid the accounts out of my own money while you were away and now i need the money back and you have it to pay me i haven t got it you have it i said it s in the cash box now and you can pay me i need that money for something he said you don t know all the needs i have for money i stayed here all the time you were in spain and you authorized me to pay these things as they came up all these things of the house and you didn t send any money while you were gone and i paid over six hundred pesos in my own money and now i need it and you can pay me i ll pay you soon he said right now i need the money badly for what for my own business why don t you pay me some on account i can t he said i need that money too badly but i will pay you he had only fought twice in spain they couldn t stand him there they saw through him quick enough and he had seven new fighting suits made and this is the kind of thing he was he had them packed so badly that four of them were ruined by sea water on the trip back and he couldn t even wear them my god i said to him you go to spain you stay there the whole season and only fight two times you spend all the money you took with you on suits and then have them spoiled by salt water so you can t wear them that is the kind of season you have and then you talk to me about running your own business why don t you pay me the money you owe me so i can leave i want you here he said and i will pay you but now i need the money you need it too badly to pay for your own mother s grave to keep your mother buried don t you i said i am happy about what has happened to my mother he said you cannot understand thank christ i can t i said you pay me what you owe me or i will take it out of the cash box i will keep the cash box myself he said no you won t i said that very afternoon he came to me with a punk some fellow from his own town who was broke and said here is a paisano who needs money to go home because his mother is very sick this fellow was just a punk you understand a nobody he d never seen before but from his home town and he wanted to be the big generous matador with a fellow townsman give him fifty pesos from the cash box he told me you just told me you had no money to pay me i said and now you want to give fifty pesos to this punk he is a fellow townsman he said and he is in distress you bitch i said i gave him the key of the cash box get it yourself i m going to town don t be angry he said i m going to pay you i got the car out to go to town it was his car but he knew i drove it better than he did everything he did i could do better he knew it he couldn t even read and write i was going to see somebody and see what i could do about making him pay me he came out and said i m coming with you and i m going to pay you we are good friends there is no need to quarrel we drove into the city and i was driving just before we came into the town he pulled out twenty pesos here s the money he said you motherless bitch i said to him and told him what he could do with the money you give fifty pesos to that punk and then offer me twenty when you owe me six hundred i wouldn t take a nickel from you you know what you can do with it i got out of the car without a peso in my pocket and i didn t know where i was going to sleep that night later i went out with a friend and got my things from his place i never spoke to him again until this year i met him walking with three friends in the evening on the way to the callao cinema in the gran via in madrid he put his hand out to me hello roger old friend he said to me how are you people say you are talking against me that you say all sorts of unjust things about me all i say is you never had a mother i said to him that s the worst thing you can say to insult a man in spanish that s true he said my poor mother died when i was so young it seems as though i never had a mother it s very sad there s a queen for you you can t touch them nothing nothing can touch them they spend money on themselves or for vanity but they never pay try to get one to pay i told him what i thought of him right there on the gran via in front of three friends but he speaks to me now when i meet him as though we were friends what kind of blood is it that makes a man like that one reader writes she sat at the table in her bedroom with a newspaper folded open before her and only stopping to

thank you she brought the coffee from the kitchen and mr johnson looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform do you speak other languages besides english he asked the waitress oh yes i speak german and french and the dialects would you like a drink of something oh no sir it is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients have a cigar oh no sir she laughed i don t smoke sir neither do i said johnson it s a dirty habit the waitress went away and johnson lit a cigarette and drank the coffee the clock on the wall marked a quarter to ten his watch was a little fast the train was due at ten thirty an hour late meant eleven thirty johnson called to the waitress signorina what would you like sir you wouldn t like to play with me johnson asked the waitress blushed no sir i don t mean anything violent you wouldn t like to make up a party and see the night life of vevey bring a girl friend if you like i must work the waitress said i have my duty here i know said johnson but couldn t you get a substitute they used to do that in the civil war oh no sir i must be here myself in the person where did you learn your english at the berlitz school sir tell me about it johnson said were the berlitz undergraduates a wild lot what about all this necking and petting were there many smoothies did you ever run into scott fitzgerald please i mean were your college days the happiest days of your life what sort of team did berlitz have last fall you are joking sir only feebly said johnson you re an awfully good girl and you don t want to play with me oh no sir said the waitress would you like me to bring you something yes said johnson would you bring me the wine list yes sir johnson walked over with the wine list to the table where the three porters sat they looked up at him they were old men wollen sie trinken he asked one of them nodded and smiled oui monsieur you speak french oui monsieur what shall we drink connais vous des champagnes non monsieur faut les connaître said johnson fräulein he called the waitress we will drink champagne which champagne would you prefer sir the best said johnson laquelle est le best he asked the porters le meilleur asked the porter who had spoken first by all means the porter took out a pair of gold rimmed glasses from his coat pocket and looked over the list he ran his finger down the four typewritten names and prices sportsman he said sportsman is the best you agree gentlemen johnson asked the other porters the one porter nodded the other said in french i don t know them personally but i ve often heard speak of sportsman it s good a bottle of sportsman johnson said to the waitress he looked at the price on the wine card eleven francs swiss make it two sportsmen do you mind if i sit here with you he asked the porter who had suggested sportsman sit down put yourself here please the porter smiled at him he was folding his spectacles and putting them away in their case is it the gentleman s birthday no said johnson it s not a fête my wife has decided to divorce me so said the porter i hope not the other porter shook his head the third porter seemed a little deaf it is doubtless a common experience said johnson like the first visit to the dentist or the first time a girl is unwell but i have been upset it is understandable said the oldest porter i understand it none of you gentlemen is divorced johnson asked he had stopped clowning with the language and was speaking good french now and had been for some time no said the porter who had ordered sportsman they don t divorce much here there are gentlemen who are divorced but not many with us said johnson it s different practically every one is divorced that s true the porter confirmed i ve read it in the paper i myself am somewhat in retard johnson went on this is the first time i have been divorced i am thirty five mais vous êtes encore jeune said the porter he explained to the two others monsieur n a que trente cinq ans the other porters nodded he s very young said one and it is really the first time you ve been divorced asked the porter absolutely said johnson please open the wine mademoiselle and is it very expensive ten thousand francs swiss money no french money oh yes two thousand francs swiss all the same it s not cheap no and why does one do it one is asked to but why do they ask that to marry someone else but it s idiotic i agree with you said johnson the waitress filled the four glasses they all raised them prosit said johnson a votre santé monsieur said the porter the other two porters said salut the champagne tasted like sweet pink cider is it a system always to respond in a different language in switzerland johnson asked no said the porter french is more cultivated besides this is la suisse romande but you speak german yes where i come from they speak german i see said johnson and you say you have never been divorced no it would be too expensive besides i have never married ah said johnson and these other gentlemen they are married you like being married johnson asked one of the porters what you like the married state oui c est normale exactly said johnson et vous monsieur ça va said the other porter pour moi said johnson ça ne va pas monsieur is going to divorce the first porter explained oh said the second porter ah ha the third porter said well said johnson the subject seems to be exhausted you re not interested in my troubles he addressed the first porter but yes said the porter well let s talk about something else as you wish what can we talk about you do the sport no said johnson my wife does though what do you do for amusement i am a writer does that make much money no but later on when you get known it does it is interesting no said johnson it is not interesting i am sorry gentlemen but i have to leave you will you please drink the other bottle but the train does not come for three quarters of an hour i know said johnson the waitress came and he paid for the wine and his dinner you re going out sir she asked yes said johnson just for a little walk i ll leave my bags here he put on his muffler his coat and his hat outside the snow was falling heavily he looked back through the window at the three porters sitting at the table the waitress was filling their glasses from the last wine of the opened bottle she took the unopened bottle back to the bar that makes them three francs something apiece johnson thought he turned and walked down the platform inside the café he had thought that talking about it would blunt it but it had not blunted it it had only made him feel nasty part iii the son of a fellow member at territet in the station café at territet it was a little too warm the lights were bright and the tables shiny from polishing there were baskets with pretzels in glazed paper sacks on the tables and cardboard pads for beer glasses in order that the moist glasses would not make rings on the wood the chairs were carved but the wooden seats were worn and quite comfortable there was a clock on the wall a bar at the far end of the room and outside the window it was snowing there was an old man drinking coffee at a table under the clock and reading the evening paper a porter came in and said the simplon orient express was an hour late at saint maurice the waitress came over to mr harris s table mr harris had just finished dinner the express is an hour late sir can i bring you some coffee if you like please asked the waitress all right said mr harris thank you sir said the waitress she brought the coffee from the kitchen and mr harris put sugar in it crunched the lumps with his spoon and looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform do you speak other languages besides english he asked the waitress oh yes sir i speak german and french and the dialects which do you like best they are all very much the same sir i can t say i like one better than another would you like a drink of something or a coffee oh no sir it is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients you wouldn t take a cigar oh no sir she laughed i don t smoke sir neither do i said harris i don t agree with david belasco please belasco david belasco you can always tell him because he has his collar on backwards but i don t agree with him then too he s dead now will you excuse me sir asked the waitress absolutely said harris he sat forward in the chair and looked out of the window across the room the old man had folded his paper he looked at mr harris and then picked up his coffee cup and saucer and walked to harris s table i beg your pardon if i intrude he said in english but it has just occurred to me that you might be a member of the national geographic society please sit down harris said the gentleman sat down won t you have another coffee or a liqueur thank you said the gentleman won t you have a kirsch with me perhaps but you must have it with me no i insist harris called the waitress the old gentleman took out from an inside pocket of his coat a leather pocket book he took off a wide rubber band and drew out several papers selected one and handed it to harris that is my certificate of membership he said do you know frederick j roussel in america i m afraid i don t i believe he is very prominent where does he come from do you know what part of the states from washington of course isn t that the headquarters of the society i believe it is you believe it is aren t you sure i ve been away a long time harris said you re not a member then no but my father is he s been a member for a great many years then he would know frederick j roussel he is one of the officers of the society you will observe that it is by mr roussel that i was nominated for membership i m awfully glad i am sorry you are not a member but you could obtain nomination through your father i think so said harris i must when i go back i would advise you to said the gentleman you see the magazine of course absolutely have you seen the number with the colored plates of the north american fauna yes i have it in paris and the number containing the panorama of the volcanoes of alaska that was a wonder i enjoyed very much too the wild animal photographs of george shiras three they were damned fine i beg your pardon they were excellent that fellow shiras you call him that fellow we re old friends said harris i see you know george shiras three he must be very interesting he is he s about the most interesting man i know and do you know george shiras two is he interesting too oh he s not so interesting i should imagine he would be very interesting you know a funny thing he s not so interesting i ve often wondered why h m said the gentleman i should have thought any one in that family would be interesting do you remember the panorama of the sahara desert harris asked the sahara desert that was nearly fifteen years ago that s right that was one of my father s favorites he doesn t prefer the newer numbers he probably does but he was very fond of the sahara panorama it was excellent but to me its artistic value far exceeded its scientific interest i don t know said harris the wind blowing all that sand and that arab with his camel kneeling toward mecca as i recall the arab was standing holding the camel you re quite right said harris i was thinking of colonel lawrence s book lawrence s book deals with arabia i believe absolutely said harris it was the arab reminded me of it he must be a very interesting young man i believe he is do you know what he is doing now he s in the royal air force and why does he do that he likes it do you know if he belongs to the national geographic society i wonder if he does he would make a very good member he is the sort of person they want as a member i would be very happy to nominate him if you think they would like to have him i think they would i have nominated a scientist from vevey and a colleague of mine from lausanne and they were both elected i believe they would be very pleased if i nominated colonel lawrence it s a splendid idea said harris do you come here to the café often i come here for coffee after dinner are you in the university i am not active any longer i m just waiting for the train said harris i m going up to paris and sail from havre for the states i have never been to america but i would like to go very much perhaps i shall attend a meeting of the society some time i would be very happy to meet your father i m sure he would have liked to meet you but he died last year shot himself oddly enough i am very truly sorry i am sure his loss was a blow to science as well as to his family science took it awfully well this is my card harris said his initials were e j instead of e d i know he would have liked to know you it would have been a great pleasure the gentleman took out a card from the pocketbook and gave it to harris it read dr sigismund wyer ph d member of the national geographic society washington d c u s a i will keep it very carefully harris said a day s wait he came into the room to shut the windows while we were still in bed and i saw he looked ill he was shivering his face was white and he walked slowly as though it ached to move what s the matter schatz i ve got a headache you better go back to bed no i m all right you go to bed i ll see you when i m dressed but when i came downstairs he was dressed sitting by the fire looking a very sick and miserable boy of nine years when i put my hand on his forehead i knew he had a fever you go up to bed i said you re sick i m all right he said when the doctor came he took the boy s temperature what is it i asked him one hundred and two downstairs the doctor left three different medicines in different colored capsules with instructions for giving them one was to bring down the fever another a purgative the third to overcome an acid condition the germs of influenza can only exist in an acid condition he explained he seemed to know all about influenza and said there was nothing to worry about if the fever did not go above one hundred and four degrees this was a light epidemic of flu and there was no danger if you avoided pneumonia back in the room i wrote the boy s temperature down and made a note of the time to give the various capsules do you want me to read to you all right if you want to said the boy his face was very white and there were dark areas under his eyes he lay still in the bed and seemed very detached from what was going on i read aloud from howard pyle s book of pirates but i could see he was not following what i was reading how do you feel schatz i asked him just the same so far he said i sat at the foot of the bed and read to myself while i waited for it to be time to give another capsule it would have been natural for him to go to sleep but when i looked up he was looking at the foot of the bed looking very strangely why don t you try to go to sleep i ll wake you up for the medicine i d rather stay awake after a while he said to me you don t have to stay in here with me papa if it bothers you it doesn t bother me no i mean you don t have to stay if it s going to bother you i thought perhaps he was a little lightheaded and after giving him the prescribed capsules at eleven o clock i went out for a while it was a bright cold day the ground covered with a sleet that had frozen so that it seemed as if all the bare trees the bushes the cut brush and all the grass and the bare ground had been varnished with ice i took the young irish setter for a little walk up the road and along a frozen creek but it was difficult to stand or walk on the glassy surface and the red dog slipped and slithered and i fell twice hard once dropping my gun and having it slide away over the ice we flushed a covey of quail under a high clay bank with overhanging brush and i killed two as they went out of sight over the top of the bank some of the covey lit in trees but most of them scattered into brush piles and it was necessary to jump on the ice coated mounds of brush several times before they would flush coming out while you were poised unsteadily on the icy springy brush they made difficult shooting and i killed two missed five and started back pleased to have found a covey close to the house and happy there were so many left to find on another day at the house they said the boy had refused to let any one come into the room you can t come in he said you mustn t get what i have i went up to him and found him in exactly the position i had left him white faced but with the tops of his cheeks flushed by the fever staring still as he had stared at the foot of the bed i took his temperature what is it something like a hundred i said it was one hundred and two and four tenths it was a hundred and two he said who said so the doctor your temperature is all right i said it s nothing to worry about i don t worry he said but i can t keep from thinking don t think i said just take it easy i m taking it easy he said and looked straight ahead he was evidently holding tight onto himself about something take this with water do you think it will do any good of course it will i sat down and opened the pirate book and commenced to read but i could see he was not following so i stopped about what time do you think i m going to die he asked what about how long will it be before i die you aren t going to die what s the matter with you oh yes i am i heard him say a hundred and two people don t die with a fever of one hundred and two that s a silly way to talk i know they do at school in france the boys told me you can t live with forty four degrees i ve got a hundred and two he had been waiting to die all day ever since nine o clock in the morning you poor schatz i said poor old schatz it s like miles and kilometers you aren t going to die that s a different thermometer on that thermometer thirty seven is normal on this kind it s ninety eight are you sure absolutely i said it s like miles and kilometers you know like how many kilometers we make when we do seventy miles in the car oh he said but his gaze at the foot of the bed relaxed slowly the hold over himself relaxed too finally and the next day it was very slack and he cried very easily at little things that were of no importance a natural history of the dead it has always seemed to me that the war has been omitted as a field for the observations of the naturalist we have charming and sound accounts of the flora and fauna of patagonia by the late w h hudson the reverend gilbert white has written most interestingly of the hoopoe on its occasional and not at all common visits to selborne and bishop stanley has given us a valuable although popular familiar history of birds can we not hope to furnish the reader with a few rational and interesting facts about the dead i hope so when that persevering traveller mungo park was at one period of his course fainting in the vast wilderness of an african desert naked and alone considering his days as numbered and nothing appearing to remain for him to do but to lie down and die a small moss flower of extraordinary beauty caught his eye though the whole plant says he was no larger than one of my fingers i could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots leaves and capsules without admiration can that being who planted watered and brought to perfection in this obscure part of the world a thing which appears of so small importance look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed after his own image surely not reflections like these would not allow me to despair i started up and disregarding both hunger and fatigue travelled forward assured that relief was at hand and i was not disappointed with a disposition to wonder and adore in like manner as bishop stanley says can any branch of natural history be studied without increasing that faith love and hope which we also every one of us need in our journey through the wilderness of life let us therefore see what inspiration we may derive from the dead in war the dead are usually the male of the human species although this does not hold true with animals and i have frequently seen dead mares among the horses an interesting aspect of war too is that it is only there that the naturalist has an opportunity to observe the dead of mules in twenty years of observation in civil life i had never seen a dead mule and had begun to entertain doubts as to whether these animals were really mortal on rare occasions i had seen what i took to be dead mules but on close approach these always proved to be living creatures who seemed to be dead through their quality of complete repose but in war these animals succumb in much the same manner as the more common and less hardy horse most of those mules that i saw dead were along mountain roads or lying at the foot of steep declivities whence they had been pushed to rid the road of their encumbrance they seemed a fitting enough sight in the mountains where one was accustomed to their presence and looked less incongruous there than they did later at smyrna where the greeks broke the legs of all their baggage animals and pushed them off the quay into the shallow water to drown the numbers of broken legged mules and horses drowning in the shallow water called for a goya to depict them although speaking literally one can hardly say that they called for a goya since there has only been one goya long dead and it is extremely doubtful if these animals were they able to call would call for pictorial representation of their plight but more likely would if they were articulate call for some one to alleviate their condition regarding the sex of the dead it is a fact that one becomes so accustomed to the sight of all the dead being men that the sight of a dead woman is quite shocking i first saw inversion of the usual sex of the dead after the explosion of a munition factory which had been situated in the countryside near milan italy we drove to the scene of the disaster in trucks along poplar shaded roads bordered with ditches containing much minute animal life which i could not clearly observe because of the great clouds of dust raised by the trucks arriving where the munition plant had been some of us were put to patrolling about those large stocks of munitions which for some reason had not exploded while others were put at extinguishing a fire which had gotten into the grass of an adjacent field which task being concluded we were ordered to search the immediate vicinity and surrounding fields for bodies we found and carried to an improvised mortuary a good number of these and i must admit frankly the shock it was to find that these dead were women rather than men in those days women had not yet commenced to wear their hair cut short as they did later for several years in europe and america and the most disturbing thing perhaps because it was the most unaccustomed was the presence and even more disturbing the occasional absence of this long hair i remember that after we had searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments many of these were detached from a heavy barbed wire fence which had surrounded the position of the factory and from the still existent portions of which we picked many of these detached bits which illustrated only too well the tremendous energy of high explosive many fragments we found a considerable distance away in the fields they being carried farther by their own weight on our return to milan i recall one or two of us discussing the occurrence and agreeing that the quality of unreality and the fact that there were no wounded did much to rob the disaster of a horror which might have been much greater also the fact that it had been so immediate and that the dead were in consequence still as little unpleasant as possible to carry and deal with made it quite removed from the usual battlefield experience the pleasant though dusty ride through the beautiful lombard countryside also was a compensation for the unpleasantness of the duty and on our return while we exchanged impressions we all agreed that it was indeed fortunate that the fire which broke out just before we arrived had been brought under control as rapidly as it had and before it had attained any of the seemingly huge stocks of unexploded munitions we agreed too that the picking up of the fragments had been an extraordinary business it being amazing that the human body should be blown into pieces which exploded along no anatomical lines but rather divided as capriciously as the fragmentation in the burst of a high explosive shell a naturalist to obtain accuracy of observation may confine himself in his observations to one limited period and i will take first that following the austrian offensive of june 1918 in italy as one in which the dead were present in their greatest numbers a withdrawal having been forced and an advance later made to recover the ground lost so that the positions after the battle were the same as before except for the presence of the dead until the dead are buried they change somewhat in appearance each day the color change in caucasian races is from white to yellow to yellow green to black if left long enough in the heat the flesh comes to resemble coal tar especially where it has been broken or torn and it has quite a visible tarlike iridescence the dead grow larger each day until sometimes they become quite too big for their uniforms filling these until they seem blown tight enough to burst the individual members may increase in girth to an unbelievable extent and faces fill as taut and globular as balloons the surprising thing next to their progressive corpulence is the amount of paper that is scattered about the dead their ultimate position before there is any question of burial depends on the location of the pockets in the uniform in the austrian army these pockets were in the back of the breeches and the dead after a short time all consequently lay on their faces the two hip pockets pulled out and scattered around them in the grass all those papers their pockets had contained the heat the flies the indicative positions of the bodies in the grass and the amount of paper scattered are the impressions one retains the smell of a battlefield in hot weather one cannot recall you can remember that there was such a smell but nothing ever happens to you to bring it back it is unlike the smell of a regiment which may come to you suddenly while riding in the street car and you will look across and see the man who has brought it to you but the other thing is gone as completely as when you have been in love you remember things that happened but the sensation cannot be recalled one wonders what that persevering traveller mungo park would have seen on a battlefield in hot weather to restore his confidence there were always poppies in the wheat in the end of june and in july and the mulberry trees were in full leaf and one could see the heat waves rise from the barrels of the guns where the sun struck them through the screens of leaves the earth was turned a bright yellow at the edge of holes where mustard gas shells had been and the average broken house is finer to see than one that has been shelled but few travellers would take a good full breath of that early summer air and have any such thoughts as mungo park about those formed in his own image the first thing that you found about the dead was that hit badly enough they died like animals some quickly from a little wound you would not think would kill a rabbit they died from little wounds as rabbits die sometimes from three or four small grains of shot that hardly seem to break the skin others would die like cats a skull broken in and iron in the brain they lie alive two days like cats that crawl into the coal bin with a bullet in the brain and will not die until you cut their heads off maybe cats do not die then they say they have nine lives i do not know but most men die like animals not men i d never seen a natural death so called and so i blamed it on the war and like the persevering traveller mungo park knew that there was something else that always absent something else and then i saw one the only natural death i ve ever seen outside of loss of blood which isn t bad was death from spanish influenza in this you drown in mucus choking and how you know the patient s dead is at the end he turns to be a little child again though with his manly force and fills the sheets as full as any diaper with one vast final yellow cataract that flows and dribbles on after he s gone so now i want to see the death of any self called humanist because a persevering traveller like mungo park or me lives on and maybe yet will live to see the actual death of members of this literary sect and watch the noble exits that they make in my musings as a naturalist it has occurred to me that while decorum is an excellent thing some must be indecorous if the race is to be carried on since the position prescribed for procreation is indecorous highly indecorous and it occurred to me that perhaps that is what these people are or were the children of decorous cohabitation but regardless of how they started i hope to see the finish of a few and speculate how worms will try that long preserved sterility with their quaint pamphlets gone to bust and into foot notes all their lust while it is perhaps legitimate to deal with these self designated citizens in a natural history of the dead even though the designation may mean nothing by the time this work is published yet it is unfair to the other dead who were not dead in their youth of choice who owned no magazines many of whom had doubtless never even read a review that one has seen in the hot weather with a half pint of maggots working where their mouths have been it was not always hot weather for the dead much of the time it was the rain that washed them clean when they lay in it and made the earth soft when they were buried in it and sometimes then kept on until the earth was mud and washed them out and you had to bury them again or in the winter in the mountains you had to put them in the snow and when the snow melted in the spring some one else had to bury them they had beautiful burying grounds in the mountains war in the mountains is the most beautiful of all war and in one of them at a place called pocol they buried a general who was shot through the head by a sniper this is where those writers are mistaken who write books called generals die in bed because this general died in a trench dug in snow high in the mountains wearing an alpine hat with an eagle feather in it and a hole in front you couldn t put your little finger in and a hole in back you could put your fist in if it were a small fist and you wanted to put it there and much blood in the snow he was a damned fine general and so was general von behr who commanded the bavarian alpenkorps troops at the battle of caporetto and was killed in his staff car by the italian rearguard as he drove into udine ahead of his troops and the titles of all such books should be generals usually die in bed if we are to have any sort of accuracy in such things in the mountains too sometimes the snow fell on the dead outside the dressing station on the side that was protected by the mountain from any shelling they carried them into a cave that had been dug into the mountainside before the earth froze it was in this cave that a man whose head was broken as a flower pot may be broken although it was all held together by membranes and a skillfully applied bandage now soaked and hardened with the structure of his brain disturbed by a piece of broken steel in it lay a day a night and a day the stretcher bearers asked the doctor to go in and have a look at him they saw him each time they made a trip and even when they did not look at him they heard him breathing the doctor s eyes were red and the lids swollen almost shut from tear gas he looked at the man twice once in daylight once with a flashlight that too would have made a good etching for goya the visit with the flashlight i mean after looking at him the second time the doctor believed the stretcher bearers when they said the soldier was still alive what do you want me to do about it he asked there was nothing they wanted done but after a while they asked permission to carry him out and lay him with the badly wounded no no no said the doctor who was busy what s the matter are you afraid of him we don t like to hear him in there with the dead don t listen to him if you take him out of there you will have to carry him right back in we wouldn t mind that captain doctor no said the doctor no didn t you hear me say no why don t you give him an overdose of morphine asked an artillery officer who was waiting to have a wound in his arm dressed do you think that is the only use i have for morphine would you like me to have to operate without morphine you have a pistol go out and shoot him yourself he s been shot already said the officer if some of you doctors were shot you d be different thank you very much said the doctor waving a forceps in the air thank you a thousand times what about these eyes he pointed the forceps at them how would you like these tear gas we call it lucky if it s tear gas because you leave the line said the doctor because you come running here with your tear gas to be evacuated you rub onions in your eyes you are beside yourself i do not notice your insults you are crazy the stretcher bearers came in captain doctor one of them said get out of here said the doctor they went out i will shoot the poor fellow the artillery officer said i am a humane man i will not let him suffer shoot him then said the doctor shoot him assume the responsibility i will make a report wounded shot by lieutenant of artillery in first curing post shoot him go ahead shoot him you are not a human being my business is to care for the wounded not to kill them that is for gentlemen of the artillery why don t you care for him then i have done so i have done all that can be done why don t you send him down on the cable railway who are you to ask me questions are you my superior officer are you in command of this dressing post do me the courtesy to answer the lieutenant of artillery said nothing the others in the room were all soldiers and there were no other officers present answer me said the doctor holding a needle up in his forceps give me a response f yourself said the artillery officer so said the doctor so you said that all right all right we shall see the lieutenant of artillery stood up and walked toward him f yourself he said f yourself f your mother f your sister the doctor tossed the saucer full of iodine in his face as he came toward him blinded the lieutenant fumbled for his pistol the doctor skipped quickly behind him tripped him and as he fell to the floor kicked him several times and picked up the pistol in his rubber gloves the lieutenant sat on the floor holding his good hand to his eyes i ll kill you he said i ll kill you as soon as i can see i am the boss said the doctor all is forgiven since you know i am the boss you cannot kill me because i have your pistol sergeant adjutant adjutant the adjutant is at the cable railway said the sergeant wipe out this officer s eyes with alcohol and water he has got iodine in them bring me the basin to wash my hands i will take this officer next you won t touch me hold him tight he is a little delirious one of the stretcher bearers came in captain doctor what do you want the man in the dead house get out of here is dead captain doctor i thought you would be glad to know see my poor lieutenant we dispute about nothing in time of war we dispute about nothing f you said the lieutenant of artillery he still could not see you ve blinded me it is nothing said the doctor your eyes will be all right it is nothing a dispute about nothing ayee ayee ayee suddenly screamed the lieutenant you have blinded me you have blinded me hold him tight said the doctor he is in much pain hold him very tight the reader s indulgence is requested for this mention of an extinct phenomenon the reference like all references to fashions dates the story but it is retained because of its mild historical interest and because its omission would spoil the rhythm wine of wyoming it was a hot afternoon in wyoming the mountains were a long way away and you could see snow on their tops but they made no shadow and in the valley the grain fields were yellow the road was dusty with cars passing and all the small wooden houses at the edge of town were baking in the sun there was a tree made shade over fontan s back porch and i sat there at a table and madame fontan brought up cold beer from the cellar a motor car turned off the main road and came up the side road and stopped beside the house two men got out and came in through the gate i put the bottles under the table madame fontan stood up where s sam one of the men asked at the screen door he ain t here he s at the mines you got some beer no ain t got any beer that s a last bottle all gone what s he drinking that s a last bottle all gone go on give us some beer you know me ain t got any beer that s a last bottle all gone come on let s go some place where we can get some real beer one of them said and they went out to the car one of them walked unsteadily the motor car jerked in starting whirled on the road and went on and away put the beer on the table madame fontan said what s the matter yes all right what s the matter don t drink off the floor i didn t know who they were i said they re drunk she said that s what makes the trouble then they go somewhere else and say they got it here maybe they don t even remember she spoke french but it was only french occasionally and there were many english words and some english constructions where s fontan il fait de la

beaucoup shooter les canards mais il y a très bonne chasse aussi en france i said c est vrai fontan said nous avons beaucoup de gibier là bas madame fontan came up the stairs with the beer bottles in her hands il est catholique she said my god schmidt est catholique you think he ll be the president fontan asked no i said the next afternoon i drove out to fontan s through the shade of the town then along the dusty road turning up the side road and leaving the car beside the fence it was another hot day madame fontan came to the back door she looked like mrs santa claus clean and rosy faced and whitehaired and waddling when she walked my god hello she said it s hot my god she went back into the house to get some beer i sat on the back porch and looked through the screen and the leaves of the tree at the heat and away off the mountains there were furrowed brown mountains and above them three peaks and a glacier with snow that you could see through the trees the snow looked very white and pure and unreal madame fontan came out and put down the bottles on the table what you see out there the snow c est jolie la neige have a glass too all right she sat down on a chair beside me schmidt she said if he s the president you think we get the wine and beer all right sure i said trust schmidt already we paid seven hundred fifty five dollars in fines when they arrested fontan twice the police arrested us and once the government all the money we made all the time fontan worked in the mines and i did washing we paid it all they put fontan in jail il n a jamais fait de mal à personne he s a good man i said it s a crime we don t charge too much money the wine one dollar a litre the beer ten cents a bottle we never sell the beer before it s good lots of places they sell the beer right away when they make it and then it gives everybody a headache what s the matter with that they put fontan in jail and they take seven hundred fifty five dollars it s wicked i said where is

and afterward they come back and say they want to come again and have another party the next saturday and i say no my god no when they came i locked the door they re bad when they re drunk in the winter time when the boys go to the dance they come in the cars and wait outside and say to fontan hey sam sell us a bottle wine or they buy the beer and then they take the moonshine out of their pockets in a bottle and pour it in the beer and drink it my god that s the first time i ever saw that in my life they put whiskey in the beer my god i don t understand that they want to get sick so

said no they were all right right there at the table fontan had come in when they come again i locked the door no i said not for hundred fifty dollars my god no there is a word for such people when they do like that in french fontan said he stood looking very old and tired from the heat what cochon he said delicately hesitating to use such a strong word they were like the cochon c est un mot très fort he apologized mais vomir sur la table he shook his head sadly cochons i said that s what they are cochons salauds the grossness of the words was distasteful to fontan he was glad to speak of something else il y a des gens très gentils très sensibles qui viennent aussi he said there are officers from the fort very nice men good fellas everybody that was ever in france they want to come and drink wine they like wine all right there was one man madame fontan said and his wife never lets him get out so he tells her he s tired and goes to bed and when she goes to the show he comes straight down here sometimes in his pyjamas just with a coat over them maria some beer he says for god s sake he sits in his pyjamas and drinks the beer and then he goes up to the fort and gets back in bed before his wife comes home from the show c est un original fontan said mais vraiment gentil he s a nice fella my god yes nice fella all right madame fontan said he s always in bed when his wife gets back from the show i have to go away tomorrow i said to the crow reservation we go there for the opening of the prairie chicken season yes you come back here before you go away you come back here all right absolutely then the wine will be done fontan said we ll drink a bottle together three bottles madame fontan said i ll be back i said we count on you fontan said good night i said we got in early in the afternoon from the shooting trip we had been up that morning since five o clock the day before we had had good shooting but that morning we had not seen a prairiechicken riding in the open car we were very hot and we stopped to eat our lunch out of the sun under a tree beside the road the sun was high and the patch of shade was very small we ate sandwiches and crackers with sandwich filling on them and were thirsty and tired and glad when we finally were out and on the main road back to town we came up behind a prairie dog town and stopped the car to shoot at the prairie dogs with the pistol we shot two but then stopped because the bullets that missed glanced off the rocks and the dirt and sung off across the fields and beyond the fields there were some trees along a watercourse with a house and we did not want to get in trouble from stray bullets going toward the house so we drove on and finally were on the road coming down hill toward the outlying houses of the town across the plain we could see the mountains they were blue that day and the snow on the high mountains shone like glass the summer was ending but the new snow had not yet come to stay on the high mountains there was only the old sun melted snow and the ice and from a long way away it shone very brightly we wanted something cool and some shade we were sun burned and our lips blistered from the sun and alkali dust we turned up the side road to fontan s stopped the car outside the house and went in it was cool inside the dining room madame fontan was alone only two bottles beer she said it s all gone the new is no good yet i gave her some birds that s good she said all right thanks that s good she went out to put the birds away where it was cooler when we finished the beer i stood up we have to go i said you come back tonight all right fontan he s going to have the wine we ll come back before we go away you go away yes we have to leave in the morning that s too bad you go away you come tonight fontan will have the wine we ll make a fête before you go we ll come before we go but that afternoon there were telegrams to send the car to be gone over a tire had been cut by a stone and needed vulcanizing and without the car i walked into the town doing things that had to be done before we could go when it was supper time i was too tired to go out we did not want a foreign language all we wanted was to go early to bed as i lay in bed before i went to sleep with all the things of the summer piled around ready to be packed the windows open and the air coming in cool from the mountains i thought it was a shame not to have gone to fontan s but in a little while i was asleep the next day we were busy all morning packing and ending the summer we had lunch and were ready to start by two o clock we must go and say good by to the fontans i said yes we must i m afraid they expected us last night i suppose we could have gone i wish we d gone we said good by to the man at the desk at the hotel and to larry and our other friends in the town and then drove out to fontan s both monsieur and madame were there they were glad to see us fontan looked old and tired we thought you would come last night madame fontan said fontan had three bottles of wine when you did not come he drank it all up we can only stay a minute i said we just came to say good by we wanted to come last night we intended to come but we were too tired after the trip go get some wine fontan said there is no wine you drank it all up fontan looked very upset i ll go get some he said i ll just be gone a few minutes i drank it up last night we had it for you i knew you were tired my god i said they re too tired all right to come madame fontan said go get some wine fontan i ll take you in the car i said all right fontan said that way we ll go faster we drove down the road in the motor car and turned up a side road about a mile away you ll like that wine fontan said it s come out well you can drink it for supper tonight we stopped in front of a frame house fontan knocked on the door there was no answer we went around to the back the back door was locked too there were empty tin cans around the back door we looked in the window there was nobody inside the kitchen was dirty and sloppy but all the doors and windows were tight shut that son of a bitch where is she gone out fontan said he was desperate i know where i can get a key he said you stay here i watched him go down to the next house down the road knock on the door talk to the woman who came out and finally come back he had a key we tried it on the front door and the back but it wouldn t work that son of a bitch fontan said she s gone away somewhere looking through the window i could see where the wine was stored close to the window you could smell the inside of the house it smelled sweet and sickish like an indian house suddenly fontan took a loose board and commenced digging at the earth beside the back door i can get in he said son of a bitch i can get in there was a man in the back yard of the next house doing something to one of the front wheels of an old ford you better not i said that man will see you he s watching fontan straightened up we ll try the key once more he said we tried the key and it did not work it turned half way in either direction we can t get in i said we better go back i ll dig up the back fontan offered no i wouldn t let you take the chance i ll do it no i said that man would see then they would seize it we went out to the car and drove back to fontan s stopping on the way to leave the key fontan did not say anything but swear in english he was incoherent and crushed we went in the house that son of a bitch he said we couldn t get the wine my own wine that i made all the happiness went from madame fontan s face fontan sat down in a corner with his head in his hands we must go i said it doesn t make any difference about the wine you drink to us when we re gone where did that crazy go madame fontan asked i don t know fontan said i don t know where she go now you go away without any wine that s all right i said that s no good madame fontan said she shook her head we have to go i said good by and good luck thank you for the fine times fontan shook his head he was disgraced madame fontan looked sad don t feel bad about the wine i said he wanted you to drink his wine madame fontan said you can come back next year no maybe the year after you see fontan said to her good by i said don t think about the wine drink some for us when we re gone fontan shook his head he did not smile he knew when he was ruined that son of a bitch fontan said to himself last night he had three bottles madame fontan said to comfort him he shook his head good by he said madame fontan had tears in her eyes good by she said she felt badly for fontan good by we said we all felt very badly they stood in the doorway and we got in and i started the motor we waved they stood together sadly on the porch fontan looked very old and madame fontan looked sad she waved to us and fontan went in the house we turned up the road they felt so badly fontan felt terribly we ought to have gone last night yes we ought to have we were through the town and out on the smooth road beyond with the stubble of grain fields on each side and the mountains off to the right it looked like spain but it was wyoming i hope they have a lot of good luck they won t i said and schmidt won t be president either the cement road stopped the road was gravelled now and we left the plain and started up between two foot hills the road in a curve and commencing to climb the soil of the hills was red the sage grew in gray clumps and as the road rose we could see across the hills and away across the plain of the valley to the mountains they were farther away now and they looked more like spain than ever the road curved and climbed again and ahead there were some grouse dusting in the road they flew as we came toward them their wings beating fast then sailing in long slants and lit on the hillside below they are so big and lovely they re bigger than european patridges it s a fine country for la chasse fontan says and when the chasse is gone they ll be dead then the boy won t there s nothing to prove he won t be i said we ought to have gone last night oh yes i said we ought to have gone the gambler the nun and the radio they brought them in around mid night and then all night long every one along the corridor heard the russian where is he shot mr frazer asked the night nurse in the thigh i think what about the other one oh he s going to die i m afraid where is he shot twice in the abdomen they only found one of the bullets they were both beet workers a mexican and a russian and they were sitting drinking coffee in an all night restaurant when some one came in the door and started shooting at the mexican the russian crawled under a table and was hit finally by a stray shot fired at the mexican as he lay on the floor with two bullets in his abdomen that was what the paper said the mexican told the police he had no idea who shot him he believed it to be an accident an accident that he fired eight shots at you and hit you twice there sí señor said the mexican who was named cayetano ruiz an accident that he hit me at all the cabrón he said to the interpreter what does he say asked the detective sergeant looking across the bed at the interpreter he says it was an accident tell him to tell the truth that he is going to die the detective said na said cayetano but tell him that i feel very sick and would prefer not to talk so much he says that he is telling the truth the interpreter said then speaking confidently to the detective he don t know who shot him they shot him in the back yes said the detective i understand that but why did the bullets all go in the front maybe he is spinning around said the interpreter listen said the detective shaking his finger almost at cayetano s nose which projected waxen yellow from his dead man s face in which his eyes were alive as a hawk s i don t give a damn who shot you but i ve got to clear this thing up don t you want the man who shot you to be punished tell him that he said to the interpreter he says to tell who shot you mandarlo al carajo said cayetano who was very tired he says he never saw the fellow at all the interpreter said i tell you straight they shot him in the back ask him who shot the russian poor russian said cayetano he was on the floor with his head enveloped in his arms he started to give cries when they shoot him and he is giving cries ever since poor russian he says some fellow that he doesn t know maybe the same fellow that shot him listen the detective said this isn t chicago you re not a gangster you don t have to act like a moving picture it s all right to tell who shot you anybody would tell who shot them that s all right to do suppose you don t tell who he is and he shoots somebody else suppose he shoots a woman or a child you can t let him get away with that you tell him he said to mr frazer i don t trust that damn interpreter i am very reliable the interpreter said cayetano looked at mr frazer listen amigo said mr frazer the policeman says that we are not in chicago but in hailey montana you are not a bandit and this has nothing to do with the cinema i believe him said cayetano softly ya lo creo one can with honor denounce one s assailant every one does it here he says he says what happens if after shooting you this man shoots a woman or a child i am not married cayetano said he says any woman any child the man is not crazy cayetano said he says you should denounce him mr frazer finished thank you cayetano said you are of the great translators i speak english but badly i understand it all right how did you break your leg a fall off a horse what bad luck i am very sorry does it hurt much not now at first yes listen amigo cayetano began i am very weak you will pardon me also i have much pain enough pain it is very possible that i die please get this policeman out of here because i am very tired he made as though to roll to one side then held himself still i told him everything exactly as you said and he said to tell you truly that he doesn t know who shot him and that he is very weak and wishes you would question him later on mr frazer said he ll probably be dead later on that s quite possible that s why i want to question him now somebody shot him in the back i tell you the interpreter said oh for chrisake the detective sergeant said and put his notebook in his pocket outside in the corridor the detective sergeant stood with the interpreter beside mr frazer s wheeled chair i suppose you think somebody shot him in the back too yes frazer said somebody shot him in the back what s it to you don t get sore the sergeant said i wish i could talk spick why don t you learn you don t have to get sore i don t get any fun out of asking that spick questions if i could talk spick it would be different you don t need to talk spanish the interpreter said i am a very reliable interpreter oh for chrisake the sergeant said well so long i ll come up and see you thanks i m always in i guess you are all right that was bad luck all right plenty bad luck it s coming along good now since he spliced the bone yes but it s a long time a long long time don t let anybody shoot you in the back that s right he said that s right well i m glad you re not sore so long said mr frazer mr frazer did not see cayetano again for a long time but each morning sister cecilia brought news of him he was so uncomplaining she said and he was very bad now he had peritonitis and they thought he could not live poor cayetano she said he had such beautiful hands and such a fine face and he never complains the odor now was really terrific he would point toward his nose with one finger and smile and shake his head she said he felt badly about the odor it embarrassed him sister cecilia said oh he was such a fine patient he always smiled he wouldn t go to confession to father but he promised to say his prayers and not a mexican had been to see him since he had been brought in the russian was going out at the end of the week i could never feel anything about the russian sister cecilia said poor fellow he suffered too it was a greased bullet and dirty and the wound infected but he made so much noise and then i always like the bad ones that cayetano he s a bad one oh he must really be a bad one a thoroughly bad one he s so fine and delicately made and he s never done any work with his hands he s not a beet worker i know he s not a beet worker his hands are as smooth and not a callous on them i know he s a bad one of some sort i m going down and pray for him now poor cayetano he s having a dreadful time and he doesn t make a sound what did they have to shoot him for oh that poor cayetano i m going right down and pray for him she went right down and prayed for him in that hospital a radio did not work very well until it was dusk they said it was because there was so much ore in the ground or something about the mountains but anyway it did not work well at all until it began to get dark outside but all night it worked beautifully and when one station stopped you could go farther west and pick up another the last one that you could get was seattle washington and due to the difference in time when they signed off at four o clock in the morning it was five o clock in the morning in the hospital and at six o clock you could get the morning revellers in minneapolis that was on account of the difference in time too and mr frazer used to like to think of the morning revellers arriving at the studio and picture how they would look getting off a street car before daylight in the morning carrying their instruments maybe that was wrong and they kept their instruments at the place they revelled but he always pictured them with their instruments he had never been in minneapolis and believed he probably would never go there but he knew what it looked like that early in the morning out of the window of the hospital you could see a field with tumbleweed coming out of the snow and a bare clay butte one morning the doctor wanted to show mr frazer two pheasants that were out there in the snow and pulling the bed toward the window the reading light fell off the iron bedstead and hit mr frazer on the head this does not sound so funny now but it was very funny then every one was looking out the window and the doctor who was a most excellent doctor was pointing at the pheasants and pulling the bed toward the window and then just as in a comic section mr frazer was knocked out by the leaded base of the lamp hitting the top of his head it seemed the antithesis of healing or whatever people were in the hospital for and every one thought it was very funny as a joke on mr frazer and on the doctor everything is much simpler in a hospital including the jokes from the other window if the bed was turned you could see the town with a little smoke above it and the dawson mountains looking like real mountains with the winter snow on them those were the two views since the wheeled chair had proved to be premature it is really best to be in bed if you are in a hospital since two views with time to observe them from a room the temperature of which you control are much better than any number of views seen for a few minutes from hot empty rooms that are waiting for some one else or just abandoned which you are wheeled in and out of if you stay long enough in a room the view whatever it is acquires a great value and becomes very important and you would not change it not even by a different angle just as with the radio there are certain things that you become fond of and you welcome them and resent the new things the best tunes they had that winter were sing something simple singsong girl and little white lies no other tunes were as satisfactory mr frazer felt betty co ed was a good tune too but the parody of the words which came unavoidably into mr frazer s mind grew so steadily and increasingly obscene that there being no one to appreciate it he finally abandoned it and let the song go back to football about nine o clock in the morning they would start using the x ray machine and then the radio which by then was only getting hailey became useless many people in hailey who owned radios protested about the hospital s x ray machine which ruined their morning reception but there was never any action taken although many felt it was a shame the hospital could not use their machine at a time when people were not using their radios about the time when it became necessary to turn off the radio sister cecilia came in how s cayetano sister cecilia mr frazer asked oh he s very bad is he out of his head no but i m afraid he s going to die how are you i m very worried about him and do you know that absolutely no one has come to see him he could die just like a dog for all those mexicans care they re really dreadful do you want to come up and hear the game

they had been playing about five minutes when a probationer came into the room and said sister cecilia wants to know how the game is going tell her they have a touchdown already in a little while the probationer came into the room again tell her they re playing them off their feet mr frazer said a little later he rang the bell for the nurse who was on floor duty would you mind going down to the chapel or sending word down to sister cecilia that notre dame has them fourteen to nothing at the end of the first quarter and that it s all right she can stop praying in a few minutes sister cecilia came into the room she was very excited what does fourteen to nothing mean i don t know anything about this game that s a nice safe lead in baseball but i don t know anything about football it may not mean a thing i m going right back down to the chapel and pray until it s finished they have them beaten frazer said i promise you stay and listen with me no no no no no no no she said i m going right down to the chapel to pray mr frazer sent down word whenever notre dame scored and finally when it had been dark a long time the final result how s sister cecilia they re all at chapel she said the next morning sister cecilia came in she was very pleased and confident i knew they couldn t beat our lady she said they couldn t cayetano s better too he s much better he s going to have visitors he

that he s got to send some mexicans up to see poor cayetano he s going to send some this afternoon then that poor man will feel better it s wicked the way no one has come to see him that afternoon about five o clock three mexicans came into the room can one asked the biggest one who had very thick lips and was quite fat why not mr frazer answered sit down gentlemen will you take something many thanks said the big one thanks said the darkest and smallest one thanks no said the thin one it mounts to my head he tapped his head the nurse brought some glasses please give them the bottle frazer said it is from red lodge he explained that of red lodge is the best said the big one much better than that of big timber clearly said the smallest one and costs more too in red lodge it is of all prices said the big one how many tubes has the radio asked the one who did not drink seven very beautiful he said what does it cost i don t know mr frazer said it is rented you gentlemen are friends of cayetano no said the big one we are friends of he who wounded him we were sent here by the police the smallest one said we have a little place the big one said he and i indicating the one who did not drink he has a little place too indicating the small dark one the police tell us we have to come so we come i am very happy you have come equally said the big one will you have another little cup why not said the big one with your permission said the smallest one not me said the thin one it mounts to my head it is very good said the smallest one why not try some mr frazer asked the thin one let a little mount to your head afterwards comes the headache said the thin one could you not send friends of cayetano to see him frazer asked he has no friends every man has friends this one no what does he do he is a card player is he good i believe it from me said the smallest one he won one hundred and eighty dollars now there is no longer one hundred and eighty dollars in the world from me said the thin one he won two hundred and eleven dollars fix yourself on that figure i never played with him said the fat one he must be very rich mr frazer suggested he is poorer than we said the little mexican he has no more than the shirt on his back and that shirt is of little value now mr frazer said perforated as it is clearly the one who wounded him was a card player no a beet worker he has had to leave town fix yourself on this said the smallest one he was the best guitar player ever in this town the finest what a shame i believe it said the biggest one how he could touch the guitar there are no good guitar players left not the shadow of a guitar player there is an accordion player who is worth something the thin man said there are a few who touch various instruments the big one said you like music how would i not we will come one night with music you think the sister would allow it she seems very amiable i am sure she would permit it when cayetano is able to hear it is she a little crazy asked the thin one who that sister no mr frazer said she is a fine woman of great intelligence and sympathy i distrust all priests monks and sisters said the thin one he had bad experiences when a boy the smallest one said i was acolyte the thin one said proudly now i believe in nothing neither do i go to mass why does it mount to your head no said the thin one it is alcohol that mounts to my head religion is the opium of the poor i thought marijuana was the opium of the poor frazer said did you ever smoke opium the big one asked no nor i he said it seems it is very bad one commences and cannot stop it is a vice like religion said the thin one this one said the smallest mexican is very strong against religion it is necessary to be very strong against something mr frazer said politely i respect those who have faith even though they are ignorant the thin one said good said mr frazer what can we bring you asked the big mexican do you lack for anything i would be glad to buy some beer if there is good beer we will bring beer another copita before you go it is very good we are robbing you i can t take it it goes to my head then i have a bad headache and sick at the stomach good by gentlemen good by and thanks they went out and there was supper and then the radio turned to be as quiet as possible and still be heard and the stations finally signing off in this order denver salt lake city los angeles and seattle mr frazer received no picture of denver from the radio he could see denver from the denver post and correct the picture from the rocky mountain news nor did he ever have any feel of salt lake city or los angeles from what he heard from those places all he felt about salt lake city was that it was dean but dull and there were too many ballrooms mentioned in too many big hotels for him to see los angeles he could not feel it for the ballrooms but seattle he came to know very well the taxicab company with the big white cabs each cab equipped with radio itself he rode in every night out to the roadhouse on the canadian side where he followed the course of parties by the musical selections they phoned for he lived in seattle from two o clock on each night hearing the pieces that all the different people asked for and it was as real as minneapolis where the revellers left their beds each morning to make that trip down to the studio mr frazer grew very fond of seattle washington the mexicans came and brought beer but it was not good beer mr frazer saw them but he did not feel like talking and when they went he knew they would not come again his nerves had become tricky and he disliked seeing people while he was in this condition his nerves went bad at the end of five weeks and while he was pleased they lasted that long yet he resented being forced to make the same experiment when he already knew the answer mr frazer had been through this all before the only thing which was new to him was the radio he played it all night long turned so low he could barely hear it and he was learning to listen to it without thinking sister cecilia came into the room about ten o clock in the morning on that day and brought the mail she was very handsome and mr frazer liked to see her and to hear her talk but the mail supposedly coming from a different world was more important however there was nothing in the mail of any interest you look so much better she said you ll be leaving us soon yes mr frazer said you look very happy this morning oh i am this morning i feel as though i might be a saint mr frazer was a little taken aback at this yes sister cecilia went on that s what i want to be a saint ever since i was a little girl i ve wanted to be a saint when i was a girl i thought if i renounced the world and went into the convent i would be a saint that was what i wanted to be and that was what i thought i had to do to be one i expected i would be a saint i was absolutely sure i would be one for just a moment i thought i was one i was so happy and it seemed so simple and easy when i awoke in the morning i expected i would be a saint but i wasn t i ve never become one i want so to be one all i want is to be a saint that is all i ve ever wanted and this morning i feel as though i might be one oh i hope i will get to be one you ll be one everybody gets what they want that s what they always tell me i don t know now when i was a girl it seemed so simple i knew i would be a saint only i believed it took time when i found it did not happen suddenly now it seems almost impossible i d say you had a good chance do you really think so no i don t want just to be encouraged don t just encourage me i want to be a saint i want so to be a saint of course you ll be a saint mr frazer said no probably i won t be but oh if i could only be a saint i d be perfectly happy you re three to one to be a saint no don t encourage me but oh if i could only be a saint if i could only be a saint how s your friend cayetano he s going to get well but he s paralyzed one of the bullets hit the big nerve that goes down through his thigh and that leg is paralyzed they only found it out when he got well enough so that he could move maybe the nerve will regenerate i m praying that it will sister cecilia said you ought to see him i don t feel like seeing anybody you know you d like to see him they could wheel him in here all right they wheeled him in thin his skin transparent his hair black and needing to be cut his eyes very laughing his teeth bad when he smiled hola amigo qué tal as you see said mr frazer and thou alive and with the leg paralyzed bad mr frazer said but the nerve can regenerate and be as good as new so they tell me what about the pain not now for a while i was crazy with it in the belly i thought the pain alone would kill me sister cecilia was observing them happily she tells me you never made a sound mr frazer said so many people in the ward the mexican said deprecatingly what class of pain do you have big enough clearly not as bad as yours when the nurse goes out i cry an hour two hours it rests me my nerves are bad now you have the radio if i had a private room and a radio i would be crying and yelling all night long i doubt it hombre sí it s very healthy but you cannot do it with so many people at least mr frazer said the hands are still good they tell me you make your living with the hands and the head he said tapping his forehead but the head isn t worth as much three of your countrymen were here sent by the police to see me they brought some beer it probably was bad it was bad tonight sent by the police they come to serenade me he laughed then tapped his stomach i cannot laugh yet as musicians they are fatal and the one who shot you another fool i won thirty eight dollars from him at cards that is not to kill about the three told me you win much money and am poorer than the birds how i am a poor idealist i am the victim of illusions he laughed then grinned and tapped his stomach i am a professional gambler but i like to gamble to really gamble little gambling is all crooked for real gambling you need luck i have no luck never never i am completely without luck look this cabrón who shoots me just now can he shoot no the first shot he fires into nothing the second is intercepted by a poor russian that would seem to be luck what happens he shoots me twice in the belly he is a lucky man i have no luck he could not hit a horse if he were holding the stirrup all luck i thought he shot you first and the russian after no the russian first me after the paper was mistaken why didn t you shoot him i never carry a gun with my luck if i carried a gun i would be hanged ten times a year i am a cheap card player only that he stopped then continued when i make a sum of money i gamble and when i gamble i lose i have passed at dice for three thousand dollars and crapped out for the six with good dice more than once why continue if i live long enough the luck will change i have bad luck now for fifteen years if i ever get any good luck i will be rich he grinned i am a good gambler really i would enjoy being rich do you have bad luck with all games with everything and with women he smiled again showing his bad teeth truly truly and what is there to do continue slowly and wait for luck to change but with women no gambler has luck with women he is too concentrated he works nights when he should be with the woman no man who works nights can hold a woman if the woman is worth anything you are a philosopher no hombre a gambler of the small towns one small town then another another then a big town then start over again then shot in the belly the first time he said that has only happened once i tire you talking mr frazer suggested no he said i must tire you and the leg i have no great use for the leg i am all right with the leg or not i will be able to circulate i wish you luck truly and with all my heart mr frazer said equally he said and that the pain stops it will not last certainly it is passing it is of no importance that it passes quickly equally that night the mexicans played the accordion and other instruments in the ward and it was cheerful and the noise of the inhalations and exhalations of the accordion and of the bells the traps and the drum came down the corridor in that ward there was a rodeo rider who had come out of the chutes on midnight on a hot dusty afternoon with the big crowd watching and now with a broken back was going to learn to work in leather and to cane chairs when he got well enough to leave the hospital there was a carpenter who had fallen with a scaffolding and broken both ankles and both wrists he had lit like a cat but without a cat s resiliency they could fix him up so that he could work again but it would take a long time there was a boy from a farm about sixteen years old with a broken leg that had been badly set and was to be rebroken there was cayetano ruiz a small town gambler with a paralyzed leg down the corridor mr frazer could hear them all laughing and merry with the music made by the mexicans who had been sent by the police the mexicans were having a good time they came in very excited to see mr frazer and wanted to know if there was anything he wanted them to play and they came twice more to play at night of their own accord the last time they played mr frazer lay in his room with the door open and listened to the noisy bad music and could not keep from thinking when they wanted to know what he wished played he asked for the cucaracha which has the sinister lightness and deftness of so many of the tunes men have gone to die to they played noisily and with emotion the tune was better than most of such tunes to mr frazer s mind but the effect was all the same in spite of this introduction of emotion mr frazer went on thinking usually he avoided thinking all he could except when he was writing but now he was thinking about those who were playing and what the little one had said religion is the opium of the people he believed that that dyspeptic little joint keeper yes and music is the opium of the people old mount to the head hadn t thought of that and now economics is the opium of the people along with patriotism the opium of the people in italy and germany what about sexual intercourse was that an opium of the people of some of the people of some of the best of the people but drink was a sovereign opium of the people oh an excellent opium although some prefer the radio another opium of the people a cheap one he had just been using along with these went gambling an opium of the people if there ever was one one of the oldest ambition was another an opium of the people along with a belief in any new form of government what you wanted was the minimum of government always less government liberty what we believed in now the name of a macfadden publication we believed in that although they had not found a new name for it yet but what was the real one what was the real the actual opium of the people he knew it very well it was gone just a little way around the corner in that well lighted part of his mind that was there after two or more drinks in the evening that he knew was there it was not really there of course what was it he knew very well what was it of course bread was the opium of the people would he remember that and would it make sense in the daylight bread is the opium of the people listen mr frazer said to the nurse when she came get that little thin mexican in here will you please how do you like it the mexican said at the door very much it is a historic tune the mexican said it is the tune of the real revolution listen said mr frazer why should the people be operated on without an anæsthetic i do not understand why are not all the opiums of the people good what do you want to do with the people they should be rescued from ignorance don t talk nonsense education is an opium of the people you ought to know that you ve had a little you do not believe in education no said mr frazer in knowledge yes i do not follow you many times i do not follow myself with pleasure you want to hear the cucaracha another time asked the mexican worriedly yes said mr frazer play the cucaracha another time it s better than the radio revolution mr frazer thought is no opium revolution is a catharsis an ecstasy which can only be prolonged by tyranny the opiums are for before and for after he was thinking well a little too well they would go now in a little while he thought and they would take the cucaracha with them then he would have a little spot of the giant killer and play the radio you could play the radio so that you could hardly hear it fathers and sons there had been a sign to detour in the center of the main street of this town but cars had obviously gone through so believing it was some repair which had been completed nicholas adams drove on through the town along the empty brick paved street stopped by traffic lights that flashed on and off on this traffic less sunday and would be gone next year when the payments on the system were not met on under the heavy trees of the small town that are a part of your heart if it is your town and you have walked under them but that are only too heavy that shut out the sun and that dampen the houses for a stranger out past the last house and onto the highway that rose and fell straight away ahead with banks of red dirt sliced cleanly away and the second growth timber on both sides it was not his country but it was the middle of fall and all of this country was good to drive through and to see the cotton was picked and in the clearings there were patches of corn some cut with streaks of red sorghum and driving easily his son asleep on the seat by his side the day s run made knowing the town he would reach for the night nick noticed which corn fields had soy beans or peas in them how the thickets and the cut over land lay where the cabins and houses were in relation to the fields and the thickets hunting the country in his mind as he went by sizing up each clearing as to feed and cover and figuring where you would find a covey and which way they would fly in shooting quail you must not get between them and their habitual cover once the dogs have found them or when they flush they will come pouring at you some rising steep some skimming by your ears whirring into a size you have never seen them in the air as they pass the only way being to turn and take them over your shoulder as they go before they set their wings and angle down into the thicket hunting this country for quail as his father had taught him nicholas adams started thinking about his father when he first thought about him it was always the eyes the big frame the quick movements the wide shoulders the hooked hawk nose the beard that covered the weak chin you never thought about it was always the eyes they were protected in his head by the formation of the brows set deep as though a special protection had been devised for some very valuable instrument they saw much farther and much quicker than the human eye sees and they were the great gift his father had his father saw as a big horn ram or as an eagle sees literally he would be standing with his father on one shore of the lake his own eyes were very good then and his father would say they ve run up the flag nick could not see the flag or the flag pole there his father would say it s your sister dorothy she s got the flag up and she s walking out onto the dock nick would look across the lake and he could see the long wooded shore line the higher timber behind the point that guarded the bay the clear hills of the farm and the white of their cottage in the trees but he could not see any flag pole or any dock only the white of the beach and the curve of the shore can you see the sheep on the hillside toward the point yes they were a whitish patch on the gray green of the hill i can count them his father said like all men with a faculty that surpasses human requirements his father was very nervous then too he was sentimental and like most sentimental people he was both cruel and abused also he had much bad luck and it was not all of it his own he had died in a trap that he had helped only a little to set and they had all betrayed him in their various ways before he died all sentimental people are betrayed so many times nick could not write about him yet although he would later but the quail country made him remember him as he was when nick was a boy and he was very grateful to him for two things fishing and shooting his father was as sound on those two things as he was unsound on sex for instance and nick was glad that it had been that way for some one has to give you your first gun or the opportunity to get it and use it and you have to live where there is game or fish if you are to learn about them and now at thirty eight he loved to fish and to shoot exactly as much as when he first had gone with his father it was a passion that had never slackened and he was very grateful to his father for bringing him to know it while for the other that his father was not sound about all the equipment you will ever have is provided and each man learns all there is for him to know about it without advice and it makes no difference where you live he remembered very clearly the only two pieces of information his father had given him about that once when they were out shooting together nick shot a red squirrel out of a hemlock tree the squirrel fell wounded and when nick picked him up bit the boy clean through the ball of the thumb the dirty little bugger nick said and smacked the squirrel s head against the tree look how he bit me his father looked and said suck it out clean and put some iodine on when you get home the little bugger nick said do you know what a bugger is his father asked him we call anything a bugger nick said a bugger is a man who has intercourse with animals why nick said i don t know his father said but it is a heinous crime nick s imagination was both stirred and horrified by this and he thought of various animals but none seemed attractive or practical and that was the sum total of direct sexual knowledge bequeathed him by his father except on one other subject one morning he read in the paper that enrico caruso had been arrested for mashing what is mashing it is one of the most heinous of crimes his father answered nick s imagination pictured the great tenor doing something strange bizarre and heinous with a potato masher to a beautiful lady who looked like the pictures of anna held on the inside of cigar boxes he resolved with considerable horror that when he was old enough he would try mashing at least once his father had summed up the whole matter by stating that masturbation produced blindness insanity and death while a man who went with prostitutes would contract hideous venereal diseases and that the thing to do was to keep your hands off of people on the other hand his father had the finest pair of eyes he had ever seen and nick had loved him very much and for a long time now knowing how it had all been even remembering the earliest times before things had gone badly was not good remembering if he wrote it he could get rid of it he had gotten rid of many things by writing them but it was still too early for that there were still too many people so he decided to think of something else there was nothing to do about his father and he had thought it all through many times the handsome job the undertaker had done on his father s face had not blurred in his mind and all the rest of it was quite clear including the responsibilities he had complimented the undertaker the undertaker had been both proud and smugly pleased but it was not the undertaker that had given him that last face the undertaker had only made certain dashingly executed repairs of doubtful artistic merit the face had been making itself and being made for a long time it had modelled fast in the last three years it was a good story but there were still too many people alive for him to write it nick s own education in those earlier matters had been acquired in the hemlock woods behind the indian camp this was reached by a trail which ran from the cottage through the woods to the farm and then by a road which wound through the slashings to the camp now if he could still feel all of that trail with bare feet first there was the pine needle loam through the hemlock woods behind the cottage where the fallen logs crumbled into wood dust and long splintered pieces of wood hung like javelins in the tree that had been struck by lightning you crossed the creek on a log and if you stepped off there was the black muck of the swamp you climbed a fence out of the woods and the trail was hard in the sun across the field with cropped grass and sheep sorrel and mullen growing and to the left the quaky bog of the creek bottom where the killdeer plover fed the spring house was in that creek below the barn there was fresh warm manure and the other older manure that was caked dry on top then there was another fence and the hard hot trail from the barn to the house and the hot sandy road that ran down to the woods crossing the creek on a bridge this time where the cat tails grew that you soaked in kerosene to make jack lights with for spearing fish at night then the main road went off to the left skirting the woods and climbing the hill while you went into the woods on the wide clay and shale road cool under the trees and broadened for them to skid out the hemlock bark the indians cut the hemlock bark was piled in long rows of stacks roofed over with more bark like houses and the peeled logs lay huge and yellow where the trees had been felled they left the logs in the woods to rot they did not even clear away or burn the tops it was only the bark they wanted for the tannery at boyne city hauling it across the lake on the ice in winter and each year there was less forest and more open hot shadeless weed grown slashing but there was still much forest then virgin forest where the trees grew high before there were any branches and you walked on the brown clean springy needled ground with no undergrowth and it was cool on the hottest days and they three lay against the trunk of a hemlock wider than two beds are long with the breeze high in the tops and the cool light that came in patches and billy said you want trudy again you want to un huh come on no here but billy i no mind billy he my brother then afterwards they sat the three of them listening for a black squirrel that was in the top branches where they could not see him they were waiting for him to bark again because when he barked he would jerk his tail and nick would shoot where he saw any movement his father gave him only three cartridges a day to hunt with and he had a single barrel twenty gauge shotgun with a very long barrel son of a bitch never move billy said you shoot nickie scare him we see him jump shoot him again trudy said it was a long speech for her i ve only got two shells nick said son of a bitch said billy they sat against the tree and were quiet nick was feeling hollow and happy eddie says he going to come some night sleep in bed with you sister dorothy what he said trudy nodded that s all he want do she said eddie was their older half brother he was seventeen if eddie gilby ever comes at night and even speaks to dorothy you know what i d do to him i d kill him like this nick cocked the gun and hardly taking aim pulled the trigger blowing a hole as big as your hand in the head or belly of that half breed bastard eddie gilby like that i d kill him like that he better not come then trudy said she put her hand in nick s pocket he better watch out plenty said billy he s big bluff trudy was exploring with her hand in nick s pocket but don t you kill him you get plenty trouble i d kill him like that nick said eddie gilby lay on the ground with all his chest shot away nick put his foot on him proudly i d scalp him he said happily no said trudy that s dirty i d scalp him and send it to his mother his mother dead trudy said don t you kill him nickie don t you kill him for me after i scalped him i d throw him to the dogs billy was very depressed he better watch out he said gloomily they d tear him to pieces nick said pleased with the picture then having scalped that halfbreed renegade and standing watching the dogs tear him his face unchanging he fell backward against the tree held tight around the neck trudy holding choking him and crying no kill him no kill him no kill him no no no nickie nickie nickie what s the matter with you no kill him i got to kill him he just a big bluff all right nickie said i won t kill him unless he comes around the house let go of me that s good trudy said you want to do anything now i feel good now if billy goes away nick had killed eddie gilby then pardoned him his life and he was a man now you go billy you hang around all the time go on son a bitch billy said i get tired this what we come hunt or what you can take the gun there s one shell all right i get a big black one all right i ll holler nick said then later it was a long time after and billy was still away you think we make a baby trudy folded her brown legs together happily and rubbed against him something inside nick had gone a long way away i don t think so he said make plenty baby what the hell they heard billy shoot i wonder if he got one don t care said trudy billy came through the trees he had the gun over his shoulder and he held a black squirrel by the front paws look he said bigger than a cat you all through where d you get him over there saw him jump first got to go home nick said no said trudy i got to get there for supper all right want to hunt tomorrow all right you can have the squirrel all right come out after supper no how you feel good all right give me kiss on the face said trudy now as he rode along the highway in the car and it was getting dark nick was all through thinking about his father the end of the day never made him think of him the end of the day had always belonged to nick alone and he never felt right unless he was alone at it his father came back to him in the fall of the year or in the early spring when there had been jacksnipe on the prairie or when he saw shocks of corn or when he saw a lake or if he ever saw a horse and buggy or when he saw or heard wild geese or in a duck blind remembering the time an eagle dropped through the whirling snow to strike a canvas covered decoy rising his wings beating the talons caught in the canvas his father was with him suddenly in deserted orchards and in new plowed fields in thickets on small hills or when going through dead grass whenever splitting wood or hauling water by grist mills cider mills and dams and always with open fires the towns he lived in were not towns his father knew after he was fifteen he had shared nothing with him his father had frost in his beard in cold weather and in hot weather he sweated very much he liked to work in the sun on the farm because he did not have to and he loved manual work which nick did not nick loved his father but hated the smell of him and once when he had to wear a suit of his father s underwear that had gotten too small for his father it made him feel sick and he took it off and put it under two stones in the creek and said that he had lost it he had told his father how it was when his father had made him put it on but his father had said it was freshly washed it had been too when nick had asked him to smell of it his father sniffed at it indignantly and said that it was clean and fresh when nick came home from fishing without it and said he lost it he was whipped for lying afterwards he had sat inside the woodshed with the door open his shotgun loaded and cocked looking across at his father sitting on the screen porch reading the paper and thought i can blow him to hell i can kill him finally he felt his anger go out of him and he felt a little sick about it being the gun that his father had given him then he had gone to the indian camp walking there in the dark to get rid of the smell there was only one person in his family that he liked the smell of one sister all the others he avoided all contact with that sense blunted when he started to smoke it was a good thing it was good for a bird dog but it did not help a man what was it like papa when you were a little boy and used to hunt with the indians i don t know nick was startled he had not even noticed the boy was awake he looked at him sitting beside him on the seat he had felt quite alone but this boy had been with him he wondered for how long we used to go all day to hunt black squirrels he said my father only gave me three shells a day because he said that would teach me to hunt and it wasn t good for a boy to go banging around i went with a boy named billy gilby and his sister trudy we used to go out nearly every day all one summer those are funny names for indians yes aren t they nick said but tell me what they were like they were ojibways nick said and they were very nice but what were they like to be with it s hard to say nick adams said could you say she did first what no one has ever done better and mention plump brown legs flat belly hard little breasts well holding arms quick searching tongue the flat eyes the good taste of mouth then uncomfortably tightly sweetly moistly lovely tightly achingly fully finally unendingly never endingly never to endingly suddenly ended the great bird flown like an owl in the twilight only it was daylight in the woods and hemlock needles stuck against your belly so that when you go in a place where indians have lived you smell them gone and all the empty pain killer bottles and the flies that buzz do not kill the sweetgrass smell the smoke smell and that other like a fresh cased marten skin nor any jokes about them nor old squaws take that away nor the sick sweet smell they get to have nor what they did finally it wasn t how they ended they all ended the same long time ago good now no good and about the other when you have shot one bird flying you have shot all birds flying they are all different and they fly in different ways but the sensation is the same and the last one is as good as the first he could thank his father for that you might not like them nick said to the boy but i think you would and my grandfather lived with them too when he was a boy didn t he yes when i asked him what they were like he said that he had many friends among them will i ever live with them i don t know nick said that s up to you how old will i be when i get a shotgun and can hunt by myself twelve years old if i see you are careful i wish i was twelve now you will be soon enough what was my grandfather like i can t remember him except that he gave me an air rifle and an american flag when i came over from france that time what was he like he s hard to describe he was a great hunter and fisherman and he had wonderful eyes was he greater than you he was a much better shot and his father was a great wing shot too i ll bet he wasn t better than you oh yes he was he shot very quickly and beautifully i d rather see him shoot than any man i ever knew he was always very disappointed in the way i shot why do we never go to pray at the tomb of my grandfather we live in a different pan of the country it s a long way from here in france that wouldn t make any difference in france we d go i think i ought to go to pray at the tomb of my grandfather sometime we ll go i hope we won t live somewhere so that i can never go to pray at your tomb when you are dead we ll have to arrange it don t you think we might all be buried at a convenient place we could all be buried in france that would be fine i don t want to be buried in france nick said well then we ll have to get some convenient place in america couldn t we all be buried out at the ranch that s an idea then i could stop and pray at the tomb of my grandfather on the way to the ranch you re awfully practical well i don t feel good never to have even visited the tomb of my grandfather we ll have to go nick said i can see we ll have to go part ii short stories published in books or magazines subsequent to the first forty nine one trip across you know how it is there early in the morning in havana with the bums still asleep against the walls of the buildings before even the ice wagons come by with ice for the bars well we came across the square from the dock to the pearl of san francisco café to get coffee and there was only one beggar awake in the square and he was getting a drink out of the fountain but when we got inside the café and sat down there were the three of them waiting for us we sat down and one of them came over well he said i can t do it i told him i d like to do it as a favor but i told you last night i couldn t you can name your own price it isn t that i can t do it that s all the two others had come over and they stood there looking sad they were nice looking fellows all right and i would have liked to have done them the favor a thousand apiece said the one who spoke good english don t make me feel bad i told him i tell you true i can t do it afterwards when things are changed it would mean a good deal to you i know it i m all for you but i can t do it why not i make my living with the boat if i lose her i lose my living with the money you buy another boat not in jail they must have thought i just needed to be argued into it because the one kept on you would have three thousand dollars and it could mean a great deal to you later all this will not last you know listen i said i don t care who is president here but i don t carry anything to the states that can talk you mean we would talk one of them who hadn t spoken said he was angry i said anything that can talk do you think we are lenguas largas no do you know what a lengua larga is yes one with a long tongue do you know what we do with them don t be tough with me i said you propositioned me i didn t offer you anything shut up pancho the one who had done the talking before said to the angry one he said we would talk pancho said listen i said i told you i didn t carry anything that can talk sacked liquor can t talk demijohns can t talk there s other things that can t talk men can talk can chinamen talk pancho said pretty nasty they can talk but i can t understand them i told him so you won t it s just like i told you last night i can t but you won t talk pancho said the one thing that he hadn t understood right had made him nasty i guess it was disappointment too i didn t even answer him you re not a lengua larga are you he asked still nasty i don t think so what s that a threat listen i told him don t be so tough so early in the morning i m sure you ve cut plenty people s throats i haven t even had my coffee yet so you re sure i ve cut people s throats no i said and i don t give a damn can t you do business without getting angry i am angry now he said i would like to kill you oh hell i told him don t talk so much come on pancho the first one said then to me i am very sorry i wish you would take us i m sorry too but i can t the three of them started for the door and i watched them go they were good looking young fellows wore good clothes none of them wore hats and they looked like they had plenty of money they talked plenty of money anyway and they spoke the kind of english cubans with money speak two of them looked like brothers and the other one pancho was a little taller but the same sort of looking kid you know slim good clothes and shiny hair i didn t figure he was as mean as he talked i figured he was plenty nervous as they turned out of the door to the right i saw a closed car come across the square toward them the first thing a pane of glass went and the bullet smashed into the row of bottles on the showcase wall to the right i heard the gun going and bop bop bop there were bottles smashing all along the wall i jumped behind the bar on the left side and could see looking over the edge the car was stopped and there were two fellows crouched down by it one had a thompson gun and the other had a sawed off automatic shotgun the one with the thompson gun was a nigger the other had a chauffeur s white duster on one of the boys was spread out on the sidewalk face down just outside the big window that was smashed the other two were behind one of the tropical beer ice wagons that was stopped in front of the cunard bar next door one of the ice wagon horses was down in the harness kicking and the other was plunging his head off one of the boys shot from the rear corner of the wagon and it ricocheted off the sidewalk the nigger with the tommy gun got his face almost into the street and gave the back of the wagon a burst from underneath and sure enough one came down falling toward the sidewalk with his head above the curb he flopped there putting his hands over his head and the chauffeur shot at him with the shotgun while the nigger put in a fresh pan but it was a long shot you could see the buckshot marks all over the sidewalk like silver splatters the other fellow pulled the one who was hit back by the legs to behind the wagon and i saw the nigger getting his face down on the paving to give them another burst then i saw old pancho come around the corner of the wagon and step into the lee of the horse that was still up he stepped clear of the horse his face white as a dirty sheet and got the chauffeur with the big luger he had holding it in both hands to keep it steady he shot twice over the nigger s head coming on and once low he hit a tire on the car because i saw dust blowing in a spurt on the street as the air came out and at ten feet the nigger shot him in the belly with his tommy gun with what must have been the last shot in it because i saw him throw it down and old pancho sat down hard and went over forward he was trying to come up still holding onto the luger only he couldn t get his head up when the nigger took the shotgun that was lying against the wheel of the car by the chauffeur and blew the side of his head off some nigger i took a quick one out of the first bottle i saw open and i couldn t tell you yet what it was the whole thing made me feel pretty bad i slipped along behind the bar and out through the kitchen in back and all the way out i went clean around the outside of the square and never even looked over toward the crowd there was coming fast in front of the café and went in through the gate and out onto the dock and got on board the fellow who had her chartered was on board waiting i told him what had happened where s eddy this fellow johnson that had her chartered asked me i never saw him after the shooting started do you suppose he was hit hell no i tell you the only shots that came in the café were into the show case that was when the car was coming behind them that was when they shot the first fellow right in front of the window they came at an angle like this you seem awfully sure about it he said i was watching i told him then as i looked up i saw eddy coming along the dock looking taller and sloppier than ever he walked with his joints all slung wrong there he is eddy looked pretty bad he never looked too good early in the morning but he looked plenty bad now where were you i asked him on the floor did you see it johnson asked him don t talk about it mr johnson eddy said to him it makes me sick to even think about it you better have a drink johnson told him then he said to me well are we going out that s up to you what sort of a day will it be just about like yesterday maybe better let s get out then all right as soon as the bait comes we d had this bird out three weeks fishing the stream and i hadn t seen any of his money yet except one hundred dollars he gave me to pay the consul and clear and get some grub and put gas in her before we came across i was furnishing all the tackle and he had her chartered at thirty five dollars a day he slept at a hotel and came aboard every morning eddy got me the charter so i had to carry him i was giving him four dollars a day i ve got to put gas in her i told johnson all right i ll need some money for that how much it s twenty eight cents a gallon i ought to put in forty gallons anyway that s eleven twenty he got out fifteen dollars do you want to put the rest on the beer and the ice i asked him that s fine he said just put it down against what i owe you i was thinking three weeks was a long time to let him go but if he was good for it what difference was there he should have paid every week anyway but i ve let them run a month and got the money it was my fault but i was glad to see it run at first it was only the last few days he made me nervous but i didn t want to say anything for fear of getting him plugged at me if he was good for it the longer he went the better have a bottle of beer he asked me opening the box no thanks just then this nigger we had getting bait comes down the dock and i told eddy to get ready to cast her off the nigger came on board with the bait and we cast off and started out of the harbor the nigger fixing on a couple of mackerel passing the hook through their mouth out the gills slitting the side and then putting the hook through the other side and out tying the mouth shut on the wire leader and tying the hook good so it couldn t slip and so the bait would troll smooth without spinning he s a real black nigger smart and gloomy with blue voodoo beads around his neck under his shirt and an old straw hat what he liked to do on board was sleep and read the papers but he put on a nice bait and he was fast can t you put on a bait like that captain johnson asked me yes sir why do you carry a nigger to do it when the big fish run you ll see i told him what s the idea the nigger can do it faster than i can can t eddy do it no sir it seems an unnecessary expense to me he d been giving the nigger a dollar a day and the nigger had been on a rumba every night i could see him getting sleepy already he s necessary i said by then we had passed the smacks with their fish cars anchored in front of cabanas and the skiffs anchored fishing for mutton fish on the rock bottom by the morro and i headed her out where the gulf made a dark line eddy put the two big teasers out and the nigger had baits on three rods the stream was in nearly to soundings and as we came toward the edge you could see her running nearly purple with regular whirlpools there was a light east breeze coming up and we put up plenty of flying fish those big ones that look like the picture of lindbergh crossing the atlantic when they sail off those big flying fish are the best sign there is as far as you could see there was that faded yellow gulfweed in small patches that means the main stream is well in and there were birds ahead working over a school of little tuna you could see them jumping just little ones weighing a couple of pounds apiece put out any time you want i told johnson he put on his belt and his harness and put out the big rod with the hardy reel with six hundred yards of thirty six thread i looked back and his bait was trolling nice just bouncing along on the swell and the two teasers were diving and jumping we were going just about the right speed and i headed her into the stream keep the rod butt in the socket on the chair i told him then the rod won t be as heavy keep the drag off so you can slack to him when he hits if one ever hits with the drag on he ll jerk you overboard every day i d have to tell him the same thing but i didn t mind that one out of fifty parties you get know how to fish then when they do know half the time they re goofy and want to use line that isn t strong enough to hold anything big how does the day look he asked me it couldn t be better i told him it was a pretty day all right i gave the nigger the wheel and told him to work along the edge of the stream to the eastward and went back to where johnson was sitting watching his bait bouncing along want me to put out another rod i asked him i don t think so he said i want to hook fight and land my fish myself good i said do you want eddy to put it out and hand it to you if one strikes so you can hook him no he said i prefer to have only one rod out all right the nigger was still taking her out and i looked and saw he had seen a patch of flying fish burst out ahead and up the stream a little looking back i could see havana looking fine in the sun and a ship just coming out of the harbor past the morro i think you re going to have a chance to fight one today mr johnson i told him it s about time he said how long have we been out three weeks today that s a long time to fish they re a funny fish i told him they aren t here until they come but when they come there s plenty of them and they ve always come if they don t come now they re never coming the moon is right there s a good stream and we re going to have a good breeze there were some small ones when we first came yes i said like i told you the small ones thin out and stop before the big ones come you party boat captains always have the same line either it s too early or too late or the wind isn t right or the moon is wrong but you take the money just the same well i told him the hell of it is that it usually is too early or too late and plenty of time the wind is wrong then when you get a day that s perfect you re ashore without a party but you think today s a good day well i told him i ve had action enough for me already today but i d like to bet you re going to have plenty i hope so he said we settled down to troll eddy went forward and lay down i was standing up watching for a tail to show every once in a while the nigger would doze off and i was watching him too i bet he had some nights would you mind getting me a bottle of beer captain johnson asked me no sir i said and i dug down in the ice to get him a cold one won t you have one he asked no sir i said i ll wait till tonight i opened the bottle and was reaching it toward him when i saw this big brown bugger with a spear on him longer than your arm burst head and shoulders out of the water and smash at that mackerel he looked as big around as a saw log slack it to him i yelled he hasn t got it johnson said hold it then he d come up from deep down and missed it i knew he d turn and come for it again get ready to turn it loose to him the minute he grabs it then i saw him coming from behind under water you could see his fins out wide like purple wings and the purple stripes across the brown he came on like a submarine and his top fin came out and you could see it slice the water then he came right behind the bait and his spear came out too sort of wagging clean out of water let it go into his mouth i said johnson took his hand off the reel spool and it started to whiz and the old marlin turned and went down and i could see the whole length of him shine bright silver as he turned broadside and headed off fast toward shore put on a little drag i said not much he screwed down on the drag not too much i said i could see the line slant up shut her down hard and sock him i said you ve got to sock him he s going to jump anyway johnson screwed the drag down and came back on the rod sock him i told him stick it into him hit him half a dozen times he hit him pretty hard a couple of times more and then the rod bent double and the reel commenced to screech and out he came boom in a long straight jump shining silver in the sun and making a splash like throwing a horse off a cliff ease up on the drag i told him he s gone said johnson the hell he is i told him ease up on the drag quick i could see the curve in the line and the next time he jumped he was astern and headed out to sea then he came out again and smashed the water white and i could see he was hooked in the side of his mouth the stripes showed clear on him he was a fine fish bright silver now barred with purple and as big around as a log he s gone johnson said the line was slack reel on him i said he s hooked good put her ahead with all the machine i yelled to the nigger then once twice he came out stiff as a post the whole length of him jumping straight toward us throwing the water high each time he landed the line came taut and i saw he was headed inshore again and i could see he was turning now he ll make his run i said if he hooks up i ll chase him keep your drag light there s plenty of line the old marlin headed out to the nor west like all the big ones go and brother did he hook up he started jumping in those long lopes and every splash would be like a speed boat in a sea we went after him keeping him on the quarter once i d made the turn i had the wheel and i kept yelling to johnson to keep his drag light and reel fast all of a sudden i see his rod jerk and the line go slack it wouldn t look slack unless you knew about it because of the pull of the belly of the line in the water but i knew he s gone i told him the fish was still jumping and he went on jumping until he was out of sight he was a fine fish all right i can still feel him pull johnson said that s the weight of the line i can hardly reel it maybe he s dead look at him i said he s still jumping you could see him out a half a mile still throwing spouts of water i felt his drag he had it screwed down tight you couldn t pull out any line it had to break didn t i tell you to keep your drag light but he kept taking out line so what so i tightened it listen i told him if you don t give them line when they hook up like that they break it there isn t any line will hold them when they want it you ve got to give it to them you have to keep a light drag the market fishermen can t hold them tight when they do that even with a harpoon line what we have to do is use the boat to chase them so they don t take it all when they make their run after they make their run they ll sound and you can tighten up the drag and get it back then if it hadn t broken i would have caught him you d have had a chance he couldn t have kept that up could he he can do plenty of other things it isn t until after he s made his run that the fight starts well let s catch one he said you have to reel that line in first i told him we d hooked that fish and lost him without waking eddy up now old eddy came back astern what s the matter he said eddy was a good man on a boat once before he got to be a rummy but he isn t any good now i looked at him standing there tall and hollowcheeked with his mouth loose and that white stuff in the corners of his eyes and his hair all faded in the sun i knew he woke up dead for a drink you d better drink a bottle of beer i told him he took one out of the box and drank it well mr johnson he said i guess i better finish my nap much obliged for the beer sir some eddy the fish didn t make any difference to him well we hooked another one around noon and he jumped off you could see the hook go thirty feet in the air when he threw it what did i do wrong then johnson asked nothing i said he just threw it mr johnson said eddy who d waked up to have another bottle of beer mr johnson you re just unlucky now maybe you re lucky with women mr johnson what do you say we go out tonight then he went back and lay down again about four o clock when we re coming back close in to shore against the stream it going like a mill race us with the sun at our backs the biggest black marlin i ever saw in my life hit johnson s bait we d put out a feather squid and caught four of those little tuna and the nigger put one on his hook for bait it trolled pretty heavy but it made a big splash in the wake johnson took the harness off the reel so he could put the rod across his knees because his arms got tired holding it in position all the time because his hands got tired holding the spool of the reel against the drag of the big bait he screwed the drag down when i wasn t looking i never knew he had it down i didn t like to see him hold the rod that way but i hated to be crabbing at him all the time besides with the drag off line would go out so there wasn t any danger but it was a sloppy way to fish i was at the wheel and was working the edge of the stream opposite that old cement factory where it makes deep so close in to shore and where it makes a son of eddy where there is always lots of bait then i saw a splash like a depth bomb and the sword and eye and open lower jaw and huge purple black head of a black marlin the whole top fin was up out of water looking as high as a fullrigged ship and the whole scythe tall was out as he smashed at that tuna the bill was as big around as a baseball bat and slanted up and as he grabbed the bait he sliced the ocean wide open he was solid purple black and he had an eye as big as a soup bowl he was huge i bet he d go a thousand pounds i yelled to johnson to let him have line but before i could say a word i saw johnson rise up in the air off the chair as though he was being derricked and him holding just for a second onto that rod and the rod bending like a bow and then the butt caught him in the belly and the whole works went overboard he d screwed the drag tight and when the fish struck it lifted johnson right out of the chair and he couldn t hold it he d had the butt under one leg and the rod across his lap if he d had the harness on it would have taken him along too i cut out the engine and went back to the stern he was sitting there holding onto his belly where the rod butt had hit him i guess that s enough for today i said what was it he said to me black marlin i said how did it happen you figure it out i said the reel cost two hundred and fifty dollars it costs more now the rod cost me forty five there was a little under six hundred yards of thirty six thread just then eddy slaps him on the back mr johnson he says you re just unlucky you know i never saw that happen before in my life shut up you rummy i said to him i tell you mr johnson eddy said that s the rarest occurrence i ever saw in my life what would i do if i was hooked to a fish like that johnson said that s what you wanted to fight all by yourself i told him i was plenty sore they re too big johnson said why it would just be punishment listen i said a fish like that would kill you they catch them people who know how to fish catch them but don t think they don t take punishment i saw a picture of a girl who caught one sure i said still fishing he swallowed the bait and they pulled his stomach out and he came to the top and died i m talking about trolling them when they re hooked in the mouth well said johnson they re too big if it isn t enjoyable why do it that s right mr johnson eddy said if it isn t enjoyable why do it listen mr johnson you hit the nail on the head there if it isn t enjoyable why do it i was still shaky from seeing that fish and feeling plenty sick about the tackle and i couldn t listen to them i told the nigger to head her for the morro i didn t say anything to them and there they sat eddy in one of the chairs with a bottle of beer and johnson with another captain he said to me after a while could you make me a highball i made him one without saying anything and then i made myself a real one i was thinking to myself that this johnson had fished fifteen days finally he hooks into a fish a fisherman would give a year to tie into he loses him he loses my heavy tackle he makes a fool of himself and he sits there perfectly content drinking with a rummy when we got in to the dock and the nigger was standing there waiting i said what about tomorrow i don t think so johnson said i m about fed up with this kind of fishing you want to pay off the nigger how much do i owe him a dollar you can give him a tip if you want so johnson gave the nigger a dollar and two cuban twenty cent pieces what s this for the nigger asks me showing the coins a tip i told him in spanish you re through he gives you that don t come tomorrow no the nigger gets his ball of twine he used for tying baits and his dark glasses puts on his straw hat and goes without saying good bye he was a nigger that never thought much of any of us when do you want to settle up mr johnson i asked him i ll go to the bank in the morning johnson said we can settle up in the afternoon do you know how many days there are fifteen no there s sixteen with today and a day each way makes eighteen then there s the rod and reel and the line from today the tackle s your risk no sir not when you lose it that way i ve paid every day for the rent of it it s your risk no sir i said if a fish broke it and it wasn t your fault that would be something else you lost that whole outfit by carelessness the fish pulled it out of my hands because you had the drag on and didn t have the rod in the socket you have no business to charge for that if you hired a car and ran it off a cliff don t you think you d have to pay for it not if i was in it johnson said that s pretty good mr johnson eddy said you see it don t you cap if he was in it he d be killed so he wouldn t have to pay that s a good one i didn t pay any attention to the rummy you owe two hundred and ninety five dollars for that rod and reel and line i told johnson well it s not right he said but if that s the way you feel about it why not split the difference i can t replace it for under three hundred and sixty i m not charging you for the line a fish like that could get all your line and it not be your fault if there was anyone here but a rummy they d tell you how square i m being with you i know it seems like a lot of money but it was a lot of money when i bought the tackle too you can t fish like that without the best tackle you can buy mr johnson he says i m a rummy maybe i am but i tell you he s right he s right and he s reasonable eddy told him i don t want to make any difficulties johnson said finally i ll pay for it even though i don t see it that s eighteen days at thirty five dollars and two ninety five extra you gave me a hundred i told him i ll give you a list of what i spent and i ll deduct what grub there is left what you bought for provisions going over and back that s reasonable johnson said listen mr johnson eddy said if you knew the way they usually charge a stranger you d know it was more than reasonable do you know what it is it s exceptional the cap is treating you like you were his own mother i ll go to the bank tomorrow and come down in the afternoon then i ll get the boat day after tomorrow you can go back with us and save the boat fare no he said i ll save time with the boat well i said what about a drink fine said johnson no hard feelings now are there no sir i told him so the three of us sat there in the stern and drank a highball together the next day i worked around her all morning changing the oil in her base and one thing and another at noon i went uptown and ate at a chink place where you get a good meal for forty cents and then i bought some things to take home to my wife and our three girls you know perfume a couple of fans and two of those high combs when i finished i stopped in at donovan s and had a beer and talked with the old man and then walked back to the san francisco docks stopping in at three or four places for a beer on the way i bought frankie a couple at the cunard bar and i came on board feeling pretty good when i came on board i had just forty cents left frankie came on board with me and while we sat and waited for johnson i drank a couple of cold ones out of the ice box with frankie eddy hadn t shown up all night or all day but i knew he would be around sooner or later as soon as his credit ran out donovan told me he d been in there the night before a little while with johnson and eddy had been setting them up on credit we waited and i began to wonder about johnson not showing up i d left word at the dock for them to tell him to go on board and wait for me but they said he hadn t come still i figured he had been out late and probably didn t get up till around noon the banks were open until three thirty we saw the plane go out and about five thirty i was all over feeling good and was getting plenty worried at six o clock i sent frankie up to the hotel to see if johnson was there i still thought he might be out on a time or he might be there at the hotel feeling too bad to get up i kept waiting and waiting until it was late but i was getting plenty worried because he owed me eight hundred and twenty five dollars frankie was gone about a little over half an hour when i saw him coming he was walking fast and shaking his head he went on the plane he said all right there it was the consulate was closed i had forty cents and anyhow the plane was in miami by now i couldn t even send a wire some mr johnson all right it was my fault i should have known better well i said to frankie we might as well have a cold one mr johnson bought them there were three bottles of tropical left frankie felt as bad as i did i don t know how he could but he seemed to he just kept slapping me on the back and shaking his head so there it was i was broke i d lost five hundred and thirty dollars of the charter and tackle i couldn t replace for three hundred and fifty more how some of that gang that hangs around the dock would be pleased at that i thought it certainly would make some conchs happy and the day before i turned down three thousand dollars to land three aliens on the keys anywhere just to get them out of the country all right what was i going to do now i couldn t bring in a load because you have to have money to buy the booze and besides there s no money in it any more the town is flooded with it and there s nobody to buy it but i was damned if i was going home broke and starve a summer in that town besides i ve got a family the clearance was paid when we came in you usually pay the broker in advance and he enters you and clears you hell i didn t even have enough money to put in gas it was a hell of a note all right some mr johnson i ve got to carry something frankie i said i ve got to make some money i ll see said frankie he hangs around the water front and does odd jobs and is pretty deaf and drinks too much every night but you never saw a fellow more loyal nor with a better heart i ve known him since i first started to run over there he used to help me load plenty of times then when i got handling stuff and went party boating and broke out this swordfishing in cuba i used to see him a lot around the dock and around the café he seems dumb and he usually smiles instead of talking but that s because he s deaf you carry anything frankie asked sure i said i can t choose now anything sure i ll see frankie said where will you be i ll be at the perla i told him i have to eat you can get a good meal at the perla for twenty five cents everything on the menu is a dime except soup and that is a nickel i walked as far as there with frankie and i went in and he went on before he went he shook me by the hand and clapped me on the back again don t worry he said me frankie much politics much business much drinking no money but big friend don t worry so long frankie i said don t you worry either boy i went in the perla and sat down at a table they had a new pane of glass in the window that had been shot up and the show case was all fixed up there were a lot of gallegos drinking at the bar and some eating one table was playing dominoes already i had black bean soup and a beef stew with boiled potatoes for fifteen cents a bottle of hatuey beer brought it up to a quarter when i spoke to the waiter about the shooting he wouldn t say anything they were all plenty scared i finished the meal and sat back and smoked a cigarette and worried my head off then i saw frankie coming in the door with someone behind him yellow stuff i thought to myself so it s yellow stuff this is mr sing frankie said and he smiled he d been pretty fast all right and he knew it how do you do said mr sing mr sing was about the smoothest looking thing i d ever seen he was a chink all right but he talked like an englishman and he was dressed in a white suit with a silk shirt and black tie and one of those hundred and twenty five dollar panama hats you will have some coffee he asked me if you do thank you said mr sing we are quite alone here except for everybody in the café i told him that is all right mr sing said you have a boat thirty eight feet i said hundred horse kermath ah said mr sing i had imagined it was a lugger it can carry two hundred and sixty five cases without being loaded would you care to charter it to me on what terms you need not go i will provide a captain and a crew no i said i go on her wherever she goes i see said mr sing would you mind leaving us he said to frankie frankie looked as interested as ever and smiled at him he s deaf i said he doesn t understand much english i see said mr sing you speak spanish tell him to rejoin us later i motioned to frankie with my thumb he got up and went over to the bar you don t speak spanish i said oh yes said mr sing now what are the circumstances that would that have made you consider i m broke i see said mr sing does the boat owe any money can she be libeled no quite so mr sing said how many of my unfortunate compatriots could your boat accommodate you mean carry that s it how far a day s voyage i don t know i said she can take a dozen if they didn t have any baggage they would not have baggage where do you want to carry them i d leave that to you mr sing said you mean where to land them you would embark them for the tortugas where a schooner would pick them up listen i said there s a lighthouse at the tortugas on loggerhead key with a radio that works both ways quite said mr sing it would certainly be very silly to land them there then what i said you would embark them for there that is what their passage calls for yes i said you would land them wherever your best judgment dictated will the schooner come to tortugas to get them of course not said mr sing how silly how much are they worth a head fifty dollars said mr sing no how would seventy five do what do you get a head oh that s quite beside the point you see there are a great many facets or shall we say angles to my issuing the tickets it doesn t stop there yes i said and what i m supposed to do doesn t have to be paid for either eh i see your point absolutely said mr sing should we say a hundred dollars apiece listen i said do you know how long i would go to jail if they pick me up on this ten years said mr sing ten years at least but there is no reason to go to jail my dear captain you run only one risk when you load your passengers everything else is left to your discretion and if they come back on your hands that s quite simple i would accuse you to them of having betrayed me i will make a partial refund and ship them out again they realize of course that it is a difficult voyage what about me i suppose i should send some word to the consulate i see twelve hundred dollars captain is not to be despised at present when would i get the money two hundred when you agree and a thousand when you load if i would go off with the two hundred i could do nothing of course he smiled but i know you wouldn t do such a thing captain have you got the two hundred with you of course put it under the plate he did all right i said i ll clear in the morning and pull out at dark now where do we load how would bacuranao be all right have you got it fixed of course now about the loading i said you show two lights one above the other at the point i ll come in when i see them you come out in a boat and load from the boat you come yourself and you bring the money i won t take one on board until i have it no he said one half when you start to load and the other when you are finished all right i said that s reasonable so everything is understood i guess so i said there s no baggage and no arms no guns knives or razors nothing i have to know about that captain said mr sing have you no trust in me don t you see our interests are identical you ll make sure please do not embarrass me he said do you not see how our interests coincide all right i told him what time will you be there before midnight all right i said i guess that s all how do you want the money in hundreds is all right he stood up and i watched him go out frankie smiled at him as he went he was a smooth looking chink all right some chink frankie came over to the table well he said where did you know mr sing he ships chinamen frankie said big business how long you know him he s here about two years frankie said another one ship them before him somebody kill him somebody will kill mr sing too sure said frankie why not plenty big business some business i said big business said frankie ship chinamen never come back other chinamen write letters say everything fine wonderful i said this kind of chinamen no understand write chinamen can write all rich eat nothing live on rice hundred thousand chinamen here only three chinese women why government no let hell of a situation i said you do business him maybe good business said frankie better than politics much money plenty big business have a bottle of beer i told him you not worry any more hell no i said plenty big business much obliged good said frankie and patted me on the back make me happier than nothing all i want is you happy chinamen good business eh wonderful make me happy said frankie i saw he was about ready to cry because he was so pleased everything was all right so i patted him on the back some frankie first thing in the morning i got hold of the broker and told him to clear us he wanted the crew list and i told him nobody you re going to cross alone captain that s right what s become of your mate he s on a drunk i told him it s very dangerous to go alone it s only ninety miles i said do you think having a rummy on board makes any difference i ran her over to the standard oil dock across the harbor and filled up both the tanks she held nearly two hundred gallons when i had her full i hated to buy it at twenty eight cents a gallon but i didn t know where we might go ever since i d seen the chink and taken the money i d been worrying about the business i don t think i slept all night i brought her back to the san francisco dock and there was eddy waiting on the dock for me hello harry he said to me and waved i threw him the stern line and he made her fast and then came aboard longer blearier drunker than ever i didn t say anything to him what do you think about that fellow johnson going off like that harry he asked me what do you know about that get out of here i told him you re poison to me brother don t i feel as bad about it as you do get off of her i told him he just settled back in the chair and stretched his legs out i hear we re going across today he said well i guess there isn t any use to stay around you re not going what s the matter harry there s no sense to get plugged with me no get off her oh take it easy i hit him in the face and he stood up and then climbed up onto the dock i wouldn t do a thing like that to you harry he said i m not going to carry you i told him that s all well what did you have to hit me for so you d believe it what do you want me to do stay here and starve starve hell i said you can get work on the ferry you can work your way back you aren t treating me square he said who did you treat square you rummy i told him you d double cross your own mother that was true too but i felt bad about hitting him you know how you feel when you hit a drunk but i wouldn t carry him the way things were now not even if i wanted to he started to walk off down the dock looking longer than a day without breakfast then he turned and came back how s to let me take a couple of dollars harry i gave him a five dollar bill of the chink s i always knew you were my pal harry why don t you carry me you re bad luck you re just plugged he said never mind old pal you ll be glad to see me yet now he had money he went off a good deal faster but i tell you it was poison to see him walk even he walked just like his joints were backwards i went up to the perla and met the broker and he gave me the papers and i bought him a drink then i had lunch and frankie came in fellow gave me this for you he said and handed me a rolled up sort of tube wrapped in paper and tied with a piece of red string it looked like a photograph when i unwrapped it and i unrolled it thinking it was maybe a picture someone around the dock had taken of the boat all right it was a close up picture of the head and chest of a dead nigger with his throat cut clear across from ear to ear and then stitched up neat and a card on his chest saying in spanish this is what we do to lenguas largas who gave it to you i asked frankie he pointed out a spanish boy that works around the docks who is just about gone with the con this kid was standing at the lunch counter ask him to come over the kid came over he said two young fellows gave it to him about eleven o clock they asked him if he knew me and he said yes then he gave it to frankie for me they gave him a dollar to see that i got it they were well dressed he said politics frankie said oh yes i said they think you told the police you were meeting those boys here that morning oh yes bad politics frankie said good thing you go did they leave any message i asked the spanish boy no he said just to give you that i m going to have to leave now i said to frankie bad politics frankie said very bad politics i had all the papers in a bunch that the broker had given me and i paid the bill and walked out of that café and across the square and through the gate and i was plenty glad to come through the warehouse and get out on the dock those kids had me spooked all right they were just dumb enough to think i d tipped somebody off about that other bunch those kids were like pancho when they were scared they got excited and when they got excited they wanted to kill somebody i got on board and warmed up the engine frankie stood on the dock watching he was smiling that funny deaf smile i went back to him listen i said don t you get in any trouble about this he couldn t hear me i had to yell it at him me good politics frankie said he cast her off i waved to frankie who d thrown the bowline on board and i headed her out of the slip and dropped down the channel with her a british freighter was going out and i ran along beside her and passed her i went out the harbor and past the morro and put her on the course for key west due north i left the wheel and went forward and coiled up the bowline and then came back and held her on her course spreading havana out astern and then dropping it off behind us as we brought the mountains up i dropped the morro out of sight after a while and then the national hotel and finally i could just see the dome of the capitol there wasn t much current compared to the last day we had fished and there was only a light breeze i saw a couple of smacks headed in toward havana and they were coming from the westward so i knew the current was light i cut the switch and killed the motor there wasn t any sense in wasting gas i d let her drift when it got dark i could always pick up the light of the morro or if she drifted up too far the lights of cojimar and steer in and run along to bacuranao i figured the way the current looked she would drift the twelve miles up to bacuranao by dark and i d see the lights of baracóa well i killed the engine and climbed up forward to have a look around all there was to see was the two smacks off to the westward headed in and way back the dome of the capitol standing up white out of the edge of the sea there was some gulfweed on the stream and a few birds working but not many i sat up there awhile on top of the house and watched but the only fish i saw were those little brown ones that rise around the gulfweed brother don t let anybody tell you there isn t plenty of water between havana and key west i was just on the edge of it after a while i went down into the cockpit again and there was eddy what s the matter what s the matter with the engine she broke down why haven t you got the hatch up oh hell i said do you know what he d done he d come back again and slipped the forward hatch and gone down into the cabin and gone to sleep he had two quarts with him he d gone into the first bodega he d seen and bought it and come aboard when i started out he woke up and went back to sleep again when i stopped her out in the gulf and she began to roll a little with the swell it woke him up i knew you d carry me harry he said carry you to hell i said you aren t even on the crew list i ve got a good mind to make you jump overboard now you re an old joker harry he said us conchs ought to stick together when we re in trouble you i said with your mouth who s going to trust your mouth when you re hot i m a good man harry you put me to the test and see what a good man i am get me the two quarts i told him i was thinking of something else he brought them out and i took a drink from the open one and put them forward by the wheel he stood there and i looked at him i was sorry for him and for what i knew i d have to do hell i knew him when he was a good man what s the matter with her harry she s all right what s the matter then what are you looking at me like that for brother i told him and i was sorry for him you re in plenty of trouble what do you mean harry i don t know yet i said i haven t got it all figured out yet we sat there awhile and i didn t feel like talking to him any more once i knew it it was hard to talk to him then i went below and got out the pump gun and the winchester thirty thirty that i always had below in the cabin and hung them up in their cases from the top of the house where we hung the rods usually right over the wheel where i could reach them i keep them in those full length clipped sheep s wool cases soaked in oil that s the only way you can keep them from rusting on a boat i loosened up the pump and worked her a few times and then filled her up and pumped one into the barrel i put a shell in the chamber of the winchester and filled up the magazine i got out the smith and wesson thirty eight special i had when i was on the police force up in miami from under the mattress and cleaned and oiled it and filled it up and put it on my belt what s the matter eddy said what the hell s the matter nothing i told him what s all the damn guns for i always carry them on board i said to shoot birds that bother the baits or to shoot sharks cruising along the keys what s the matter damn it said eddy what s the matter nothing i told him i sat there with the old thirty eight flopping against my leg when she rolled and i looked at him i thought there s no sense to do it now i m going to need him now we re going to do a little job i said in at bacuranao i ll tell you what to do when it s time i didn t want to tell him too far ahead because he would get to worrying and get so spooked he wouldn t be any use you couldn t have anybody better than me harry he said i m the man for you i m with you on anything i looked at him tall and bleary and shaky and i didn t say anything listen harry would you give me just one he asked me i don t want to get the shakes i gave him one and we sat and waited for it to get dark it was a fine sunset and there was a nice light breeze and when the sun got pretty well down i started the engine and headed her in slow toward land we lay offshore about a mile in the dark the current had freshened up with the sun down and i noticed it running in i could see the morro light way down to the westward and the glow of havana and the lights opposite us were rincón and baracóa i headed her up against the current until i was past bacuranao and nearly to cojimar then i let her drift down it was plenty dark but i could tell good where we were i had all the lights out what s it going to be harry eddy asked me he was beginning to be spooked again what do you think i don t know he said you ve got me worried he was pretty close to the shakes and when he came near me he had a breath like a buzzard what time is it i ll go down and see he said he came back up and said it was half past nine are you hungry i asked him no he said you know i couldn t eat harry all right i told him you can have one after he had it i asked him how he felt he said he felt fine i m going to give you a couple more in a little while i told him i know you haven t got any guts unless you ve got rum and there isn t much on board so you d better go easy tell me what s up said eddy listen i said talking to him in the dark we re going in to bacuranao and pick up twelve chinks you take the wheel when i tell you to and do what i tell you to we ll take the twelve chinks on board and we ll lock them below forward go on forward now and fasten the hatch from the outside he went up and i saw him shadowed against the dark he came back and he said harry can i have one of those now no i said i want you rum brave i don t want you useless i m a good man harry you ll see you re a rummy i said listen one chink is going to bring those twelve out he s going to give me some money at the start when they re all on board he s going to give me some more money when you see him start to hand me money the second time you put her ahead and hook her up and head her out to sea don t you pay any attention to what happens you keep her going out no matter what happens do you understand yes if any chink starts bursting out of the cabin or coming through the hatch once we re out and under way you take that pump gun and blow them back as fast as they come out do you know how to use the pump gun no but you can show me you d never remember do you know how to use the winchester just pump the lever and shoot it that s right i said only don t shoot any holes in the hull you d better give me that other drink eddy said all right i ll give you a little one i gave him a real one i knew they wouldn t make him drunk now not pouring into all that fear but each one would work for a little while after he drank this eddy said just as though he was happy so we re going to run chinks well by god i always said i d run chinamen if i was ever broke but you never got broke before eh i said to him he was funny all right i gave him three more drinks to keep him brave before it was half past ten it was funny watching him and it kept me from thinking about it myself i hadn t figured on all this wait i d planned to leave after dark run out just out of the glare and coast along to cojimar at a little before eleven i saw the two lights show on the point i waited a little while and then i took her in slow bacuranao is a cove where there used to be a big dock for loading sand there is a little river that comes in when the rains open the bar across the mouth the northers in the winter pile the sand up and close it they used to go in with schooners and load guavas from the river and there used to be a town but the hurricane took it and it is all gone now except one house that some gallegos built out of the shacks the hurricane blew down and that they use for a clubhouse on sundays when they come out to swim and picnic from havana there is one other house where the delegate lives but it is back from the beach each little place like that all down the coast has a government delegate but i figured the chink must use his own boat and have him fixed as we came in i could smell the sea grape and that sweet smell from the brush you get off the land get up forward i said to eddy you can t hit anything on that side he said the reef s on the other side as you go in you see he d been a good man once watch her i said and i took her in to where i knew they could see us with no surf they could hear the engine i didn t want to wait around not knowing whether they saw us or not so i flashed the running lights on once just the green and red and turned them off then i turned her and headed her out and let her lay there just outside with the engine just ticking there was quite a little swell that close in come on back here i said to eddy and i gave him a real drink do you cock it first with your thumb he whispered to me he was sitting at the wheel now and i had reached up and had both the cases open and the butts pulled out about six inches that s right oh boy he said it certainly was wonderful what a drink would do to him and how quick we lay there and i could see a light from the delegate s house back through the bush i saw the two lights on the point go down and one of them moving off around the point they must have blown the other one out then in a little while coming out of the cove i see a boat come toward us with a man sculling i could tell by the way he swung back and forth i knew he had a big oar i was pretty pleased if they were sculling that meant one man they came alongside good evening captain said mr sing come astern and put her broadside i said to him he said something to the man who was sculling but he couldn t scull her backwards so i took hold of the gunwale and passed her astern there were eight men in the boat the six chinks mr sing and the kid sculling while i was pulling her astern i was waiting for something to hit me on top of the head but nothing did i straightened up and let mr sing hold onto the stern let s see what it looks like i said he handed it to me and i took it up to where eddy was at the wheel and put on the binnacle light i looked at it carefully it looked all right to me and i turned off the light eddy was trembling pour one yourself i said i saw him reach for the bottle and tip it up i went back to the stern all right i said let six come on board mr sing and the cuban that sculled were having a job holding their boat from knocking in what little swell there was i heard mr sing say something in chink and all the chinks in the boat started to climb onto the stern one at a time i said he said something again and then one after another six chinks came over the stern they were all lengths and sizes show them forward i said to eddy right this way gentlemen said eddy by god i knew he had taken a big one lock the cabin i said when they were all in yes sir said eddy i will return with the others said mr sing o k i told him i pushed them clear and the boy with him started sculling off listen i said to eddy you lay off that bottle you re brave enough now o k chief said eddy what s the matter with you this is what i like to do said eddy you say you just pull it backward with your thumb you lousy rummy i told him give me a drink out of that all gone said eddy sorry chief listen what you have to do now is watch her when he hands me the money and put her ahead o k chief said eddy i reached up and took the other bottle and got the corkscrew and drew the cork i took a good drink and went back to the stem putting the cork in tight and laying the bottle behind two wicker jugs full of water here comes mr sing i said to eddy yes sir said eddy the boat came out sculling toward us he brought her astern and i let them do the holding in mr sing had hold of the roller we had across the stern to slide a big fish on board let them come aboard i said one at a time six more assorted chinks came on board over the stern open up and show them forward i told eddy yes sir said eddy lock the cabin yes sir i saw he was at the wheel all right mr sing i said let s see the rest of it he put his hand in his pocket and reached the money out toward me i reached for it and grabbed his wrist with the money in his hand and as he came forward on the stern i grabbed his throat with the other hand i felt her start and then churn ahead as she hooked up and i was plenty busy with mr sing but i could see the cuban standing in the stem of the boat holding the sculling oar through all the flopping and bouncing mr sing was doing he was flopping and bouncing worse than any dolphin on a gaff i got his arm around behind him and came up on it but i brought it too far because i felt it go when it went he made a funny little noise and came forward me holding him throat and all and bit me on the shoulder but when i felt the arm go i dropped it it wasn t any good to him any more and i took him by the throat with both hands and brother that mr sing would flop just like a fish true his loose arm flailing but i got him forward onto his knees and had both thumbs well in behind his talk box and i bent the whole thing back until she cracked don t think you can t hear it crack either i held him quiet just a second and then i laid him down across the stem he lay there face up quiet in his good clothes with his feet in the cockpit and i left him i picked up the money off the cockpit floor and took it up and put it on the binnacle and counted it then i took the wheel and told eddy to look under the stem for some pieces of iron that i used for anchoring whenever we fished bottom fishing on patches or rocky bottom where you wouldn t want to risk an anchor i can t find anything he said he was scared being down there by mr sing take the wheel i said keep her out there was a certain amount of moving around going on below but i wasn t spooked about them i found a couple of pieces of what i wanted iron from the old coaling dock at tortugas and i took some snapper line and made a couple of good big pieces fast to mr sing s ankles then when we were about two miles offshore i slid him over he slid over smooth off the roller i never even looked in his pockets i didn t feel like fooling with him he d bled a little on the stern from his nose and his mouth and i dipped a bucket of water that nearly pulled me overboard the way we were going and cleaned her off good with a scrub brush from under the stern slow her down i said to eddy what if he floats up eddy said i dropped him in about seven hundred fathoms i said he s going down all that way that s a long way brother he won t float till the gas brings him up and all the time he s going with the current and baiting up fish hell i said you don t have to worry about mr sing what did you have against him eddy asked me nothing i said he was the easiest man to do business with i ever met i thought there must be something wrong all the time what did you kill him for to keep from killing twelve other chinks i told him harry he said you ve got to give me one because i can feel them coming on it made me sick to see his head all loose like that so i gave him one what about the chinks eddy said i want to get them out as quick as i can i told him before they smell up the cabin where are you going to put them we ll run them right in to the long beach i told him take her in now sure i said take her in slow we came in slow over the reef and to where i could see the beach shine there is plenty of water over the reef and inside it s all sandy bottom and slopes right in to shore get up forward and give me the depth he kept sounding with a grains pole motioning me on with the pole he came back and motioned me to stop i came astern on her you ve got about five feet we ve got to anchor i said if anything happens so we haven t time to get her up we can cut loose or break her off eddy paid out rope and when finally she didn t drag he made her fast she swung stern in it s sandy bottom you know he said how much water have we got at the stern not over five feet you take the rifle i said and be careful let me have one he said he was plenty nervous i gave him one and took down the pump gun i unlocked the cabin door opened it and said come on out nothing happened then one chink put his head out and saw eddy standing there with a rifle and ducked back come on out nobody s going to hurt you i said nothing doing only lots of talk in chink come on out you eddy said my god i knew he d had the bottle put that bottle away i said to him or i ll blow you out of the boat come on out i said to them or i ll shoot in at you i saw one of them looking at the corner of the door and he saw the beach evidently because he begins to chatter come on i said or i ll shoot out they came now i tell you it would take a hell of a mean man to butcher a bunch of chinks like that and i ll bet there would be plenty of trouble too let alone mess they came out and they were scared and they didn t have any guns but there were twelve of them i walked backwards down to the stem holding the pump gun get overboard i said it s not over your heads nobody moved over you go nobody moved you yellow rat eating aliens eddy said get overboard shut your drunken mouth i told him no swim one chink said no need swim i said no deep come on get overboard eddy said come astern here i said take your gun in one hand and your grains pole in the other and show them how deep it is he showed them no need swim the one asked me no true yes where we cuba you damn crook he said and went over the side hanging on and then letting go his head went under but he came up and his chin was out of water damn crook he said damn crook he was mad and he was plenty brave he said something in chink and the others started going into the water off the stern all right i said to eddy get the anchor up as we headed her out the moon started to come up and you could see the chinks with just their heads out of water walking ashore and the shine of the beach and the brush behind we got out past the reef and i looked back once and saw the beach and the mountains starting to show up then i put her on her course for key west now you can take a sleep i said to eddy no wait go below and open up all the ports to get the stink out and bring me the iodine what s the matter he said when he brought it i cut my finger do you want me to steer get a sleep i said i ll wake you up he lay down on the built in bunk in the cockpit over the gas tank and in a little while he was asleep i held the wheel with my knee and opened up my shirt and saw where mr sing bit me it was quite a bite and i put iodine on it and then i sat there steering and wondering whether a bite from a chinaman was poisonous and listened to her running nice and smooth and the water washing along her and i figured hell no that bite wasn t poisonous a man like that mr sing probably scrubbed his teeth two or three times a day some mr sing he certainly wasn t much of a business man maybe he was maybe he just trusted me i tell you i couldn t figure him well now it was all simple except for eddy because he s a rummy he ll talk when he gets hot i sat there steering and i looked at him and i thought hell he s as well off dead as the way he is and then i m all clear when i found he was on board i decided i d have to do away with him but then when everything had come out so nice i didn t have the heart but looking at him lying there it certainly was a temptation but then i thought there s no sense spoiling it by doing something you d be sorry for afterwards then i started to think he wasn t even on the crew list and i d have a fine to pay for bringing him in and i didn t know how to consider him well i had plenty of time to think about it and i held her on her course and every once in a while i d take a drink out of the bottle he d brought on board there wasn t much in it and when i d finished it i opened up the only one i had left and i tell you i felt pretty good steering and it was a pretty night to cross it had turned out a good trip all right finally even though it had looked plenty bad plenty of times when it got daylight eddy woke up he said he felt terrible take the wheel a minute i told him i want to look around i went back to the stem and threw a little water on her but she was perfectly clean i scrubbed the brush over the side i unloaded the guns and stowed them below but i still kept the gun on my belt it was fresh and nice as you want it below no smell at all a little water had come in through the starboard port onto one of the bunks was all so i shut the ports there wasn t a customhouse officer in the world could smell chink in her now i saw the clearance papers in the net bag hanging up under her framed license where i d shoved them when i came on board and i took them out to look them over then i went up to the cockpit listen i said how did you get on the crew list i met the broker when he was leaving for the consulate and told him i was going god looks after rummies i told him and i took the thirty eight off and stowed it down below i made some coffee down below and then i came up and took the wheel there s coffee below i told him brother coffee wouldn t do me any good you knew you had to be sorry for him he certainly looked bad about nine o clock we saw the sand key light just about dead ahead we d seen tankers going up the gulf for quite a while we ll be in now i said to him i m going to give you the same four dollars a day just as if johnson had paid how much did you get out of last night he asked me only six hundred i told him i don t know whether he believed me or not don t i share in it that s your share i told him what i just told you and if you ever open your mouth about last night i ll hear of it and i ll do away with you you know i m no squealer harry you re a rummy but no matter how rum dumb you get if you ever talk about that i promise you i m a good man he said you oughtn t to talk to me like that they can t make it fast enough to keep you a good man i told him but i didn t worry about him any more because who was going to believe him mr sing wouldn t make any complaints the chinks weren t going to you know the boy that sculled them out wasn t eddy would mouth about it sooner or later maybe but who believes a rummy why who could prove anything naturally it would have made plenty more talk when they saw his name on the crew list that was luck for me all right i could have said he fell overboard but it makes plenty talk plenty of luck for eddy too plenty of luck all right then we came to the edge of the stream and the water quit being blue and was light and greenish and inside i could see the stakes on the long reef and on the western dry rocks and the wireless masts at key west and the la concha hotel up high out of all the low houses and plenty smoke from out where they re burning garbage sand key light was plenty close now and you could see the boathouse and the little dock alongside the light and i knew we were only forty minutes away now and i felt good to be getting back and i had a good stake now for the summertime what do you say about a drink eddy i said to him ah harry he said i always knew you were my pal the tradesman s return they came on across in the night and it blew a big breeze from the northwest when the sun was up he sighted a tanker coming down the gulf and she stood up so high and white with the sun on her in that cold air that it looked like tall buildings rising out of the sea and he said to the nigger where the hell are we the nigger raised himself up to look ain t nothing like that this side of miami you know damn well we ain t been carried up to no miami he told the nigger all i say ain t no buildings like that on no florida keys we ve been steering for sand key we ve got to see it then it or american shoals then in a little while he saw it was a tanker and not buildings and then in less than an hour he saw sand key light straight thin and brown rising out of the sea right where it ought to be you got to have confidence steering he told the nigger i got confidence the nigger said but the way this trip gone i ain t got confidence no more how s your leg it hurts me all the time it ain t nothing the man said you keep it clean and wrapped up and it ll heal by itself he was steering to the westward now to go in to lay up for the day in the mangroves by woman key where he would not see anybody and where the boat was to come out to meet them you re going to be all right he told the negro i don t know the nigger said i hurt bad i m going to fix you up good when we get in to the place he told him you aren t shot bad quit worrying i m shot he said i ain t never been shot before anyway i m shot is bad you re just scared no sir i m shot and i m hurting bad i ve been throbbing all night the nigger went on grumbling like that and he could not keep from taking the bandage off to look at it leave it alone the man who was steering told him the nigger lay on the floor of the cockpit and there were sacks of liquor shaped like hams piled everywhere he had made himself a place in them to lie down in every time he moved there was the noise of broken glass in the sacks and there was the odor of spilled liquor the liquor had run all over everything the man was steering in for woman key now he could see it now plainly i hurt the nigger said i hurt worse all the time i m sorry wesley the man said but i got to steer you treat a man no better than a dog the nigger said he was getting ugly now but the man was still sorry for him i m going to make you comfortable wesley he said you lay quiet now you don t care what happens to a man the nigger said you ain t hardly human i m going to fix you up good the man said you just lay quiet you ain t going to fix me up the nigger said the man whose name was harry said nothing then because he liked the nigger and there was nothing to do now but hit him and he couldn t hit him the nigger kept on talking why we didn t stop when they started shooting the man did not answer ain t a man s life worth more than a load of liquor the man was intent on his steering all we have to do is stop and let them take the liquor no the man said they take the liquor and the boat and you go to jail i don t mind jail the nigger said but i never wanted to get shot he was getting on the man s nerves now and the man was becoming tired of hearing him talk who the hell s shot worse he asked him you or me you re shot worse the nigger said but i ain t never been shot i didn t figure to get shot i ain t paid to get shot i don t want to be shot take it easy wesley the man told him it don t do you any good to talk like that they were coming up on the key now they were inside the shoals and as he headed her into the channel it was hard to see with the sun on the water the nigger was going out of his head or becoming religious because he was hurt anyway he was talking all the time why they ran liquor now he said prohibition s over why they keep up a traffic like that whyn t they bring the liquor in on the ferry the man steering was watching the channel closely why don t people be honest and decent and make a decent honest living the man saw where the water was rippling smooth off the bank even when he could not see the bank in the sun and he named her off he swung her around spinning the wheel with one arm and then the channel opened out and he took her slowly right up to the edge of the mangroves he came astern on the engines and threw out the two clutches i can put a anchor down he said but i can t get no anchor up i can t even move the nigger said you re certainly in a hell of a shape the man told him he had a difficult time breaking out lifting and dropping the small anchor but he got it over and paid out quite a lot of rope and the boat swung in against the mangroves so they came right into the cockpit then he went back and down into the cockpit he thought the cockpit was a hell of a sight all right all night after he had dressed the nigger s wound and the nigger had bandaged his arm he had been watching the compass steering and when it came daylight he had seen the nigger lying there in the sacks in the middle of the cockpit but then he was watching the seas and the compass and looking for the sand key light and he had never observed carefully how things were things were bad the nigger was lying in the middle of the load of sacked liquor with his leg up there were eight bullet holes through the cockpit splintered wide the glass was broken in the windshield he did not know how much stuff was smashed and wherever the nigger had not bled he himself had bled but the worst thing the way he felt at the moment was the smell of booze everything was soaked in it now the boat was lying quietly against the mangroves but he could not stop feeling the motion of the big sea they had been in all night in the gulf i m going to make some coffee he told the nigger then i ll fix you up again i don t want no coffee i do the man told him but down below he began to feel dizzy so he came out on deck again i guess we won t have coffee he said i want some water all right he gave the negro a cup of water out of a demijohn why you want to keep on running for when they started to shoot why they want to shoot the man answered i want a doctor the nigger told him what s a doctor going to do that i ain t done for you doctor going to cure me you ll have a doctor tonight when the boat comes out i don t want to wait for no boat all right the man said we re going to dump this liquor now he started to dump it and it was hard work one handed a sack of liquor only weighs about forty pounds but he had not dumped very many of them before he became dizzy again he sat down in the cockpit and then he lay down you going to kill yourself the nigger said the man lay quietly in the cockpit with his head against one of the sacks the branches of the mangroves had come into the cockpit and they made a shadow over him where he lay he could hear the wind above the mangroves and looking out at the high cold sky see the thin brown clouds of the norther nobody going to come out with this breeze he thought they won t look for us to have started with this blowing you think they ll come out the nigger asked sure the man said why not it s blowing too hard they re looking for us not with it like this what you want to lie to me for the nigger was talking with his mouth almost against a sack take it easy wesley the man told him take it easy the man says the nigger went on take it easy take what easy take dyin like a dog easy you got me here get me out take it easy the man said kindly they ain t coming the nigger said i know they ain t coming i m cold i tell you i can t stand this pain and cold i tell you the man sat up feeling hollow and unsteady the nigger s eyes watched him as he rose on one knee his right arm dangling took the hand of his right arm in his left hand and placed it between his knees and then pulled himself up by the plank nailed above the gunwale until he stood looking down at the nigger his right hand still held between his thighs he was thinking that he had never really felt pain before if i keep it out straight pulled out straight it don t hurt so bad he said let me tie it up in a sling the nigger said i can t make a bend in the elbow the man said it stiffened that way what we goin to do dump this liquor the man told him can t you put over what you can reach wesley the nigger tried to move to reach a sack then groaned and lay back do you hurt that bad wesley oh god the nigger said you don t think once you moved it it wouldn t hurt so bad i m shot the nigger said i ain t going to move the man wants me to go to dumpin liquor when i m shot take it easy you say that once more i go crazy take it easy the man said quietly the nigger made a howling noise and shuffling with his hands on the deck picked up the whetstone from under the coaming i ll kill you he said i ll cut your heart out not with no whetstone the man said take it easy wesley the nigger blubbered with his face against a sack the man went on slowly lifting the sacked packages of liquor and dropping them over the side while he was dumping the liquor he heard the sound of a motor and looking he saw a boat headed toward them coming down the channel around the end of the key it was a white boat with a buff painted house and a windshield boat coming he said come on wesley i can t i m remembering from now on the man said before was different go ahead an remember the nigger told him i ain t forgot nothing either working fast now the sweat running down his face not stopping to watch the boat coming slowly down the channel the man picked up the sacked packages of liquor with his good arm and dropped them over the side roll over he reached for the package under the nigger s head and swung it over the side the nigger raised himself up and looked here they are he said the boat was almost abeam of them it s captain willie the nigger said with a party in the stern of the white boat two men in flannels and white cloth hats sat in fishing chairs trolling and an old man in a felt hat and a windbreaker held the tiller and steered the boat close past the mangroves where the booze boat lay what you say harry the old man called as he passed the man called harry waved his good arm in reply the boat went on past the two men who were fishing looking toward the booze boat and talking to the old man harry could not hear what they were saying he ll make a turn at the mouth and come back harry said to the negro he went below and came up with a blanket let me cover you up bout time you cover me up they couldn t help but see that liquor what we goin to do willie s a good skate the man said he ll tell them in town we re out here those fellows fishing ain t going to bother us what they care about us he felt very shaky now and he sat down on the steering seat and held his right arm tight between his thighs his knees were shaking and with the shaking he could feel the ends of the bone in his upper arm grate he opened his knees lifted his arm out and let it hang by his side he was sitting there his arm hanging when the boat passed them coming back up the channel the two men in the fishing chairs were talking they had put up their rods and one of them was looking at them through a pair of glasses they were too far out for him to hear what they were saying it would not have helped him if he had heard it on board the charter boat south florida trolling down the woman key channel because it was too rough to go out to the reef captain willie adams was thinking so harry crossed last night that boy s got cojones he must have got that whole blow she s a sea boat all right how you suppose he smashed his windshield damned if i d cross a night like last night damned if i d ever run liquor from cuba they bring it all from mariel now just go in and out it s supposed to be wide open what s that you say cap what boat is that asked one of the men in the fishing chairs that boat yes that boat oh that s a key west boat what i said was whose boat is it i wouldn t know that cap is the owner a fisherman well some say he is what do you mean he does a little of everything you don t know his name no sir you called him harry not me i heard you call him harry captain willie adams took a good look at the man who was speaking to him he saw a highcheekboned thin lipped slightly pudgy face with deep set grey eyes and a contemptuous mouth looking at him from under a canvas hat there was no way that captain willie adams could know that this man was regarded as irresistibly handsome by a great many women in washington i must have called him that by mistake captain willie said you can see that the man is wounded doctor the other man said handing the glasses to his companion i can see that without glasses the man addressed as doctor said who is that man i wouldn t know said captain willie well you will know the man with the contemptuous mouth said write down the numbers on the bow i have them doctor we ll go over and have a look the doctor said are you a doctor captain willie asked not of medicine the grey eyed man told him if you re not a medical doctor i wouldn t go over there why not if he wanted us he would have signaled us if fie don t want us it s none of our business down here everybody aims to mind their own business all right suppose you mind yours then take us over to that boat captain willie continued on his way up the channel the two cylinder palmer coughing steadily didn t you hear me yes sir why don t you obey my order who the hell you think you are asked captain willie that s not the question do as i tell you who do you think you are captain willie asked again all right for your information i m one of the three most important men in the united states today what the hell you doing in key west then the other man leaned forward he s he said impressively i never heard of him said captain willie well you will said the man called doctor and so will everyone in this stinking jerkwater little town if i have to grub it out by the roots you re a nice fellow said captain willie how did you get so important he s the most intimate friend and closest adviser of said the other man nuts said captain willie if he s all that what s he doing in key west he s just here for a rest the secretary explained he s going to be that s enough harris the man called doctor said now will you take us over to that boat he said smiling he had a smile which was reserved for such occasions no sir listen you half witted fisherman i ll make life so miserable for you yes said captain willie you don t know who i am none of it don t mean anything to me said captain willie and you don t know where you are that man is a bootlegger isn t he what do you think there s probably a reward for him i doubt that he s a lawbreaker he s got a family and he s got to eat and feed them who the hell do you eat off of with people working here in key west for the government for six dollars and a half a week he s wounded that means he s been in trouble unless he shot hisself for fun you can save that sarcasm you re going over to that boat and we re going to take that man and that boat into custody into where into key west are you an officer i ve told you who he is the secretary said all right said captain willie he pushed the tiller hard over and turned the boat coming so close to the edge of the channel that the propeller threw up a circling cloud of marl he chugged down the channel toward where the other boat lay against the mangroves have you a gun aboard the man called the doctor asked captain willie no sir the two men in flannels were standing up now watching the booze boat this is better fun than fishing eh doctor the secretary said fishing is nonsense said the doctor if you catch a sailfish what do you do with it you can t eat it this is really interesting i m glad to see this at first hand wounded as he is that man cannot escape it s too rough at sea we know his boat you re really capturing him single handed said the secretary admiringly and unarmed too said the doctor with no g men nonsense said the secretary edgar hoover exaggerates his publicity said the doctor i feel we ve given him about enough rope then pull alongside he said to captain willie captain willie threw out his clutch and the boat drifted hey captain willie called to the other boat keep your heads down what s that the doctor said angrily shut up said captain willie hey he called over to the other boat listen get on into town and take it easy never mind the boat they ll take the boat dump your load and get into town i got a guy here on board some kind of a stool from washington not a g man just a stool one of the heads of the alphabet more important than the president he says he wants to pinch you he thinks you re a bootlegger he s got the numbers of the boat i ain t never seen you so i don t know who you are i couldn t identify you the boats had drifted apart captain willie went on shouting i don t know where this place is where i seen you i wouldn t know how to get back here o k came a shout from the booze boat i m taking this big alphabet man fishing until dark captain willie shouted o k he loves to fish captain willie yelled his voice almost breaking but the son of a bitch claims you can t eat em thanks brother came the voice of harry that chap your brother asked the doctor his face very red but his love for information still unappeased no sir said captain willie most everybody goes in boats calls each other brother we ll go into key west the doctor said but he said it without great conviction no sir said captain willie you gentlemen chartered me for a day i m going to see you get your money s worth you called me a halfwit but i ll see you get a full day s charter he s an old man said the doctor to his secretary should we rush him don t you try it said captain willie i d hit you right over the head with this he showed them a length of iron pipe that he used for clubbing shark why don t you gentlemen just put your lines out and enjoy yourselves you didn t come down here to get in no trouble you come down here for a rest you say you can t eat sailfish but you won t catch no sailfish in these channels you d be lucky to catch a grouper what do you think asked the doctor better leave him alone the secretary eyed the iron pipe besides you made another mistake captain willie went on sailfish is just as good eating as kingfish when we used to sell them to rios for the havana market we got ten cents a pound same as kings oh shut up said the doctor i thought you d be interested in these things as a government man ain t you mixed up in the prices of things that we eat or something ain t that it making them more costly or something making the grits dearer and the grunts cheapter fish goin down in price all the time oh shut up said the doctor on the booze boat harry had the last sack over get me the fish knife he said to the nigger it s gone harry pressed the self starters and started the engines he got the hatchet and with his left hand chopped the anchor rope through against the bit it ll sink and they ll grapple it when they pick up the load he thought i ll run her up into the garrison bight and if they re going to take her they ll take her i got to get to a doctor i don t want to lose my arm and the boat both the load is worth as much as the boat there wasn t too much of it smashed a little smashed can smell plenty he shoved the port clutch in and swung out away from the mangroves with the tide the engines ran smoothly captain willie s boat was two miles away now headed for boca grande i guess the tide s high enough to go through the lakes now harry thought he shoved in his starboard clutch and the engines roared as he pushed up the throttle he could feel her bow rise and the green mangroves coasted swiftly alongside as the boat sucked the water away from their roots i hope they don t take her he thought i hope they can fix my arm how was we to know they d shoot at us in mariel after we could go and come there open for six months that s cubans for you somebody didn t pay somebody so we got the shooting that s cubans all right hey wesley he said looking back into the cockpit where the nigger lay with the blanket over him how you feeling boogie god said wesley i couldn t feel no worse you ll feel worse when the old doctor probes for it harry told him you ain t human the nigger said you ain t got human feelings that old willie is a good skate harry was thinking there s a good skate that old willie we done better to come in than to wait it was foolish to wait i felt so dizzy and sicklike i lost my judgment ahead now he could see the white of the la concha hotel the wireless masts and the houses of town he could see the car ferries lying at the trumbo dock where he would go around to head up for the garrison bight that old willie he thought he was giving them hell wonder who those buzzards was damn if i don t feel plenty bad right now i feel plenty dizzy we done right to come in we done right not to wait mr harry said the nigger i m sorry i couldn t help dump that stuff hell said harry ain t no nigger any good when he s shot you re a all right nigger wesley above the roar of the motors and the high slapping rush of the boat through the water he felt a strange hollow singing in his heart he always felt this way coming home at the end of a trip i hope they can fix that arm he thought i got a lot of use for that arm the denunciation chicote s in the old days in madrid was a place sort of like the stork without the music and the debutantes or the waldorfs men s bar if they let girls in you know they came in but it was a man s place and they didn t have any status pedro chicote was the proprietor and he had one of those personalities that make a place he was a great bartender and he was always pleasant always cheerful and he had a lot of zest now zest is a rare enough thing and few people have it for long it should not be confused with showmanship either chicote had it and it was not faked or put on he was also modest simple and friendly he really was as nice and pleasant and still as marvelously efficient as george the chasseur at the ritz bar in paris which is about the strongest comparison you can make to anyone who has been around and he ran a fine bar in those days the snobs among the rich young men of madrid hung out at something called the nuevo club and the good guys went to chicote s a lot of people went there that i did not like the same as at the stork say but i was never in chicote s that it wasn t pleasant one reason was that you did not talk politics there there were cafés where you went for politics and nothing else but you didn t talk politics at chicote s you talked plenty of the other five subjects though and in the evening the best looking girls in the town showed up there and it was the place to start an evening from all right and we had all started some fine ones from there then it was the place where you dropped in to find out who was in town or where they had gone to if they were out of town and if it was summer and there was no one in town you could always sit and enjoy a drink because the waiters were all pleasant it was a club only you didn t have to pay any dues and you could pick a girl up there it was the best bar in spain certainly and i think one of the best bars in the world and all of us that used to hang out there had a great affection for it another thing was that the drinks were wonderful if you ordered a martini it was made with the best gin that money could buy and chicote had a barrel whisky that came from scotland that was so much better than the advertised brands that it was pitiful to compare it with ordinary scotch well when the revolt started chicote was up at san sebastian running the summer place he had there he is still running it and they say it is the best bar in franco s spain the waiters took over the madrid place and they are still running it but the good liquor is all gone now most of chicote s old customers are on franco s side but some of them are on the government side because it was a very cheerful place and because really cheerful people are usually the bravest and the bravest get killed quickest a big part of chicote s old customers are now dead the barrel whisky had all been gone for many months now and we finished the last of the yellow gin in may of 1938 there s not much there to go for now so i suppose luis delgado if he had come to madrid a little later might have stayed away from there and not gotten into that trouble but when he came to madrid in the month of november of 1937 they still had the yellow gin and they still had indian quinine water they do not seem worth risking your life for so maybe he just wanted to have a drink in the old place knowing him and knowing the place in the old days it would be perfectly understandable they had butchered a cow at the embassy that day and the porter had called up at the hotel florida to tell us that they had saved us ten pounds of fresh meat i walked over to get it through the early dusk of a madrid winter two assault guards with rifles sat on chairs outside the embassy gate and the meat was waiting at the porter s lodge the porter said it was a very good cut but that the cow was lean i offered him some roasted sunflower seeds and some acorns from the pocket of my mackinaw jacket and we joked a little standing outside the lodge on the gravel of the embassy driveway i walked home across the town with the meat heavy under my arm they were shelling up the gran via and i went into chicote s to wait it out it was noisy and crowded and i sat at a little table in one corner against the sandbagged window with the meat on the bench beside me and drank a gin and tonic water it was that week that we discovered they still had tonic water no one had ordered any since the war started and it was still the same price as before the revolt the evening papers were not yet out so i bought three party tracts from an old woman they were ten centavos apiece and i told her to keep the change from a peseta she said god would bless me i doubted this but read the three leaflets and drank the gin and tonic a waiter i had known in the old days came over to the table and said something to me no i said i don t believe it yes he insisted slanting his tray and his head in the same direction don t look now there he is it s not my business i told him nor mine either he went away and i bought the evening papers which had just come in from another old woman and read them there was no doubt about the man the waiter had pointed out we both knew him very well all i could think was the fool the utter bloody fool just then a greek comrade came over and sat down at the table he was a company commander in the fifteenth brigade who had been buried by an airplane bomb which had killed four other men and he had been sent in to be under observation for a while and then sent to a rest home or something of the sort how are you john i asked him try one of these what you call that drink mr emmunds gin and tonic what is that kind of tonic quinine try one listen i don t drink very much but is a quinine very good for fever i try little one what did the doctor say about you john is a no necessity see doctor i am all right only i have like buzzing noises all the time in the head you have to go to see him john i go all right but he not understand he says i have no papers to admit i ll call up about it i said i know the people there is the doctor a german that s right said john is a german no talk english very good just then the waiter came over he was an old man with a bald head and very old fashioned manners which the war had not changed he was very worried i have a son at the front he said i have another son killed now about this it is thy problem and you already i have told you i came in here to have a drink before eating and i work here but tell me it is thy problem i said i am not a politician do you understand spanish john i asked the greek comrade no i understand few words but i speak greek english arabic one time i speak good arabic listen you know how i get buried no i knew you were buried that s all he had a dark good looking face and very dark hands that he moved about when he talked he came from one of the islands and he spoke with great intensity well i tell you now you see i have very much experience in war before i am captain in greek army too i am good soldier so when i see plane come over there when we are in trenches there at fuentes del ebro i look at him close i look at plane come over bank turn like this he turned and banked with his hands look down on us and i say ah ha is for the general staff is made the observation pretty soon come others so just like i say come others so i am stand there and watch i watch close i look up and i point out to company what happens is come three and three one first and two behind is pass one group of three and i say to company see now is pass one formation is pass the other three and i say to company now is hokay now is all right now is nothing more to worry that the last thing i remember for two weeks when did it happen about one month ago you see is my helmet forced down over my face when am buried by bomb so i have the air in that helmet to breathe until they dig me out but i know nothing about that but in that air i breathe is the smoke from the explosion and that make me sick for long time now am i hokay only with the ringing in the head what you call this drink gin and tonic schweppes indian tonic water this was a very fancy café before the war and this used to cost five pesetas when there were only seven pesetas to the dollar we just found out they still have the tonic water and they re charging the same price for it there s only a case left is a good drink all right tell me how was this city before the war fine like now only lots to eat the waiter came over and leaned toward the table and if i don t he said it is my responsibility if you wish to go to the telephone and call this number write it down he wrote it down ask for pepé i said i have nothing against him the waiter said but it is the causa certainly such a man is dangerous to our cause don t the other waiters recognize him i think so but no one has said anything he is an old client i am an old client too perhaps then he is on our side now too no i said i know he is not i have never denounced anyone it is your problem maybe one of the other waiters will denounce him no only the old waiters know him and the old waiters do not denounce bring another of the yellow gins and some bitters i said there is tonic water still in the bottle what s he talk about asked john i only understand little bit there is a man here that we both knew in the old days he used to be a marvelous pigeon shot and i used to see him at shoots he is a fascist and for him to come here now no matter what his reasons is very foolish but he was always very brave and very foolish show him to me there at that table with the flyers which one with the very brown face the cap over one eye who is laughing now he is fascist yes that s a closest i see fascist since fuentes del ebro is a many fascist here quite a few from time to time is drink the same drink as you said john we drink that other people think we fascists eh listen you ever been south america west coast magallanes no is all right only too many oc toe pus too many what oc toe pus he pronounced it with the accent on the toe as oc toepus you know with the eight arms oh i said octopus oc toe pus said john you see i am diver too is a good place to work all right make plenty money only too many oc toe pus did they bother you i don t know about that first time i go down in magallanes harbor i see oc toe pus he is stand on his feet like this john pointed his fingers on the table and brought his hands up at the same time bringing up his shoulders and raising his eyebrows he is stand up taller than i am and he is look me right in the eye i jerk cord for them to bring me up how big was he john i cannot say absolutely because the glass in the helmet make distort a little but the head was big around more than four feet anyway and he was stand on his feet like on tip toes and look at me like this he peered in my face so when i get up out of water they take off the helmet and so i say i don t go down there any more then the man of the job says what a matter with you john the octoe pus is more afraid of you than you afraid of oc toe pus so i say to him impossible what you say we drink some more this fascist drink all right i said i was watching the man at the table his name was luis delgado and the last time i had seen him had been in 1933 shooting pigeons at saint sebastian and i remembered standing with him up on top of the stand watching the final of the big shoot we had a bet more than i could afford to bet and i believed a good deal more than he could afford to lose that year and when he paid coming down the stairs i remembered how pleasant he was and how he made it seem a great privilege to pay then i remembered our standing at the bar having a martini and i had that wonderful feeling of relief that comes when you have bet yourself out of a bad hole and i was wondering how badly the bet had hit him i had shot rottenly all week and he had shot beautifully but drawn almost impossible birds and he had bet on himself steadily should we match a duro he asked you really want to yes if you like for how much he took out a notecase and looked in it and laughed i d say for anything you like he said but suppose we say for eight thousand pesetas that s what seems to be there that was close to a thousand dollars then good i said all the fine inner quiet gone now and the hollow that gambling makes come back again who s matching who i ll match you we shook the heavy five peseta pieces in our cupped hands then each man laid his coin on the back of his left hand each coin covered with the right hand what s yours he asked i uncovered the big silver piece with the profile of alfonso xiii as a baby showing heads i said take these damned things and be a good man and buy me a drink he emptied out the notecase you wouldn t like to buy a good purdey gun would you no i said but look luis if you need some money i was holding the stiffly folded shiny heavy paper green thousandpeseta notes toward him don t be silly enrique he said we ve been gambling haven t we yes but we know each other quite well not that well right i said you re the judge of that then what will you drink what about a gin and tonic that s a marvelous drink you know so we had a gin and tonic and i felt very badly to have broken him and i felt awfully good to have won the money and a gin and tonic never tasted better to me in all my life there is no use to lie about these things or pretend you do not enjoy winning but this boy luis delgado was a very pretty gambler i don t think if people gambled for what they could afford it would be very interesting do you enrique i don t know i ve never been able to afford it don t be silly you have lots of money no i haven t i said really oh everyone has money he said it s just a question of selling something or other to get hold of it i don t have much really oh don t be silly i ve never known an american who wasn t rich i guess that was the truth all right he wouldn t have met them at the ritz bar or at chicote s either in those days and now he was back in chicote s and all the americans he would meet there now were the kind he would never have met except me and i was a mistake but i would have given plenty not to have seen him in there still if he wanted to do an absolutely damn fool thing like that it was his own business but as i looked at the table and remembered the old days i felt badly about him and i felt very badly too that i had given the waiter the number of the counterespionage bureau in seguridad headquarters he could have had seguridad by simply asking on the telephone but i had given him the shortest cut to having delgado arrested in one of those excesses of impartiality righteousness and pontius pilatry and the always dirty desire to see how people act under an emotional conflict that makes writers such attractive friends the waiter came over what do you think he asked i would never denounce him myself i said now trying to undo for myself what i had done with the number but i am a foreigner and it is your war and your problem but you are with us absolutely and always but it does not include denouncing old friends but for me for you it is different i knew this was true and there was nothing else to say only i wished i had never heard of any of it my curiosity as to how people would act in this case had been long ago and shamefully satisfied i turned to john and did not look at the table where luis delgado was sitting i knew he had been flying with the fascists for over a year and here he was in a loyalist uniform talking to three young loyalist flyers of the last crop that had been trained in france none of those new kids would know him and i wondered whether he had come to try to steal a plane or for what whatever he was there for he was a fool to come to chicote s now how do you feel john i asked feel good said john is a good drink hokay makes me feel little bit drunk maybe is a good for the buzzing in the head the waiter came over he was very excited i have denounced him he said well then i said now you haven t any problem no he said proudly i have denounced him they are on their way now to get him let s go i said to john there is going to be some trouble here is best go then said john is a plenty trouble always come even if you do best to avoid how much we owe you aren t going to stay the waiter asked no but you gave me the telephone number i know it you get to know too many telephone numbers if you stay around in this town but it was my duty yes why not duty is a very strong thing but now well you felt good about it just now didn t you maybe you will feel good about it again maybe you will get to like it you have forgotten the package the waiter said he handed me the meat which was wrapped in two envelopes which had brought copies of the spur to the piles of magazines which accumulated in one of the office rooms of the embassy i understand i said to the waiter truly he was an old client and a good client also i have never denounced anyone before i did not denounce for pleasure also i should not speak cynically or brutally tell him that i denounced him he hates me anyway by now for differences in politics he d feel badly if he knew it was you no each man must take his responsibility but you understand yes i said then lied i understand and i approve you have to lie very often in a war and when you have to lie you should do it quickly and as well as you can we shook hands and i went out the door with john i looked back at the table where luis delgado sat as i went out he had another gin and tonic in front of him and everyone at the table was laughing at something he had said he had a very gay brown face and shooter s eyes and i wondered what he was passing himself off as he was a fool to go to chicote s but that was exactly the sort of thing that he would do in order to be able to boast of it when he was back with his own people as we went out of the door and turned to walk up the street a big seguridad car drew up in front of chicote s and eight men got out of it six with submachine guns took up positions outside the door two in plain clothes went inside a man asked us for our papers and when i said foreigners he said to go along that it was all right in the dark going up the gran via there was much new broken glass on the sidewalk and much rubble under foot from the shelling the air was still smoky and all up the street it smelled of high explosive and blasted granite where you go eat asked john i have some meat for all of us and we can cook it in the room i cook it said john i cook good i remember one time when i cook on ship it will be pretty tough i said it s just been freshly butchered oh no said john is a no such thing as a touch meat in a war people were hurrying by in the dark on their way home from the cinemas where they had stayed until the shelling was over what s a matter that fascist he come to that café where they know him he was crazy to do it is a trouble with a war john said is a too many people crazy john i said i think you ve got something there back at the hotel we went in the door past the sandbags piled to protect the porter s desk and i asked for the key but the porter said there were two comrades upstairs in the room taking a bath he had given them the keys go on up john i said i want to telephone i went over to the booth and called the same number i had given the waiter hello pepé a thin lipped voice came over the phone qué tal enrique listen pepé did you pick up a certain luis delgado at chicote s sí hombre sí sin novedad without trouble he doesn t know anything about the waiter no hombre no then don t tell him tell him i denounced him then will you nothing about the waiter why when it will make no difference he is a spy he will be shot there is no choice in the matter i know i said but it makes a difference as you want hombre as you want when shall i see thee lunch tomorrow we have some meat and whisky before good hombre good salud pepé and thank you salud enrique it is nothing salud it was a strange and very deadly voice and i never got used to hearing it but as i walked up the stairs now i felt much better all we old clients of chicote s had a sort of feeling about the place i knew that was why luis delgado had been such a fool as to go back there he could have done his business some place else but if he was in madrid he had to go there he had been a good client as the waiter had said and we had been friends certainly any small acts of kindness you can do in life are worth doing so i was glad i had called my friend pepé at seguridad headquarters because luis delgado was an old client of chicote s and i did not wish him to be disillusioned or bitter about the waiters there before he died the butterfly and the tank on this evening i was walking home from the censorship office to the florida hotel and it was raining so about halfway home i got sick of the rain and stopped into chicote s for a quick one it was the second winter of shelling in the siege of madrid and everything was short including tobacco and people s tempers and you were a little hungry all the time and would become suddenly and unreasonably irritated at things you could do nothing about such as the weather i should have gone on home it was only five blocks more but when i saw chicote s doorway i thought i would get a quick one and then do those six blocks up the gran via through the mud and rubble of the streets broken by the bombardment the place was crowded you couldn t get near the bar and all the tables were full it was full of smoke singing men in uniform and the smell of wet leather coats and they were handing drinks over a crowd that was three deep at the bar a waiter i knew found a chair from another table and i sat down with a thin white faced adam s appled german i knew who was working at the censorship and two other people i did not know the table was in the middle of the room a little on your right as you go in you couldn t hear yourself talk for the singing and i ordered a gin and angostura and put it down against the rain the place was really packed and everybody was very jolly maybe getting just a little bit too jolly from the newly made catalan liquor most of them were drinking a couple of people i did not know slapped me on the back and when the girl at our table said something to me i couldn t hear it and said sure she was pretty terrible looking now i had stopped looking around and was looking at our table really pretty terrible but it turned out when the waiter came that what she had asked me was to have a drink the fellow with her was not very forceful looking but she was forceful enough for both of them she had one of those strong semi classical faces and was built like a lion tamer and the boy with her looked as though he ought to be wearing an old school tie he wasn t though he was wearing a leather coat just like all the rest of us only it wasn t wet because they had been there since before the rain started she had on a leather coat too and it was becoming to the sort of face she had by this time i was wishing i had not stopped into chicote s but had gone straight on home where you could change your clothes and be dry and have a drink in comfort on the bed with your feet up and i was tired of looking at both of these young people life is very short and ugly women are very long and sitting there at the table i decided that even though i was a writer and supposed to have an insatiable curiosity about all sorts of people i did not really care to know whether these two were married or what they saw in each other or what their politics were or whether he had a little money or she had a little money or anything about them i decided they must be in the radio any time you saw really strange looking civilians in madrid they were always in the radio so to say something i raised my voice above the noise and asked you in the radio we are the girl said so that was that they were in the radio how are you comrade i said to the german fine and you wet i said and he laughed with his head on one side you haven t got a cigarette he asked i handed him my next to the last pack of cigarettes and he took two the forceful girl took two and the young man with the old school tie face took one take another i shouted no thanks he answered and the german took it instead do you mind he smiled of course not i said i really minded and he knew it but he wanted the cigarettes so badly that it did not matter the singing had died down momentarily or there was a break in it as there is sometimes in a storm and we could all hear what we said you been here long the forceful girl asked me she pronounced it bean as in bean soup off and on i said we must have a serious talk the german said i want to have a talk with you when can we have it i ll call you up i said this german was a very strange german indeed and none of the good germans liked him he lived under the delusion that he could play the piano but if you kept him away from pianos he was all right unless he was exposed to liquor or the opportunity to gossip and nobody had even been able to keep him away from those two things yet gossip was the best thing he did and he always knew something new and highly discreditable about anyone you could mention in madrid valencia barcelona and other political centers just then the singing really started in again and you cannot gossip very well shouting so it looked like a dull afternoon at chicote s and i decided to leave as soon as i should have bought a round myself just then it started a civilian in a brown suit a white shirt black tie his hair brushed straight back from a rather high forehead who had been clowning around from table to table squirted one of the waiters with a flit gun everybody laughed except the waiter who was carrying a tray full of drinks at the time he was indignant no hay derecho the waiter said this means you have no right to do that and is the simplest and the strongest protest in spain the flit gun man delighted with his success and not seeming to give any importance to the fact that it was well into the second year of the war that he was in a city under siege where everyone was under a strain and that he was one of only four men in civilian clothes in the place now squirted another waiter i looked around for a place to duck to this waiter also was indignant and the flit gun man squirted him twice more lightheartedly some people still thought it was funny including the forceful girl but the waiter stood shaking his head his lips were trembling he was an old man and he had worked in chicote s for ten years that i knew of no hay derecho he said with dignity people had laughed however and the flit gun man not noticing how the singing had fallen off squirted his flit gun at the back of a waiter s neck the waiter turned holding his tray no hay derecho he said this time it was no protest it was an indictment and i saw three men in uniform start from a table for the flit gun man and the next thing all four of them were going out the revolving door in a rush and you heard a smack when someone hit the flit gun man on the mouth somebody else picked up the flit gun and threw it out the door after him the three men came back in looking serious tough and very righteous then the door revolved and in came the flit gun man his hair was down in his eyes there was blood on his face his necktie was pulled to one side and his shirt was torn open he had the flit gun again and as he pushed wild eyed and white faced into the room he made one general unaimed challenging squirt with it holding it toward the whole company i saw one of the three men start for him and i saw this man s face there were more men with him now and they forced the flit gun man back between two tables on the left of the room as you go in the flit gun man struggling wildly now and when the shot went off i grabbed the forceful girl by the arm and dove for the kitchen door the kitchen door was shut and when i put my shoulder against it it did not give get down here behind the angle of the bar i said she knelt there flat i said and pushed her down she was furious every man in the room except the german who lay behind a table and the public school looking boy who stood in a corner drawn up against the wall had a gun up on a bench along the wall three over blonde girls their hair dark at the roots were standing on tiptoe to see and screaming steadily i m not afraid the forceful one said this is ridiculous you don t want to get shot in a café brawl i said if that flit king has any friends here this can be very bad but he had no friends evidently because people began putting their pistols away and somebody lifted down the blonde screamers and everyone who had started over there when the shot came drew back away from the flit man who lay quietly on his back on the floor no one is to leave until the police come someone shouted from the door two policemen with rifles who had come in off the street patrol were standing by the door and at this announcement i saw six men form up just like the line up of a football team coming out of a huddle and head out through the door three of them were the men who had first thrown the flit king out one of them was the man who shot him they went right through the policemen with the rifles like good interference taking out an end and a tackle and as they went out one of the policemen got his rifle across the door and shouted no one can leave absolutely no one why did those men go why hold us if anyone s gone they were mechanics who had to return to their air field someone said but if anyone s gone it s silly to old the others everyone must wait for the seguridad things must be done legally and in order but don t you see that if any person has gone it is silly to hold the others no one can leave everyone must wait it s comic i said to the forceful girl no it s not it s simply horrible we were standing up now and she was staring indignantly at where the flit king was lying his arms were spread wide and he had one leg drawn up i m going over to help that poor wounded man why has no one helped him or done anything for him i d leave him alone i said you want to keep out of this but it s simply inhuman i ve nurse s training and i m going to give him first aid i wouldn t i said don t go near him why not she was very upset and almost hysterical because he s dead i said when the police came they held everybody there for three hours they commenced by smelling of all the pistols in this manner they would detect one which had been fired recently after about forty pistols they seemed to get bored with this and anyway all you could smell was wet leather coats then they sat at a table placed directly behind the late flit king who lay on the floor looking like a grey wax caricature of himself with grey wax hands and a grey wax face and examined people s papers with his shirt ripped open you could see the flit king had no undershirt and the soles of his shoes were worn through he looked very small and pitiful lying there on the floor you had to step over him to get to the table where two plain clothes policemen sat and examined everyone s identification papers the husband lost and found his papers several times with nervousness he had a safe conduct pass somewhere but he had mislaid it in a pocket and he kept on searching and perspiring until he found it then he would put it in a different pocket and have to go searching again he perspired heavily while doing this and it made his hair very curly and his face red he now looked as though he should have not only an old school tie but one of those little caps boys in the lower forms wear you have heard how events age people well this shooting had made him look about ten years younger while we were waiting around i told the forceful girl i thought the whole thing was a pretty good story and that i would write it sometime the way the six had lined up in single file and rushed that door was very impressive she was shocked and said that i could not write it because it would be prejudicial to the cause of the spanish republic i said that i had been in spain for a long time and that they used to have a phenomenal number of shootings in the old days around valencia under the monarchy and that for hundreds of years before the republic people had been cutting each other with large knives called navajas in andalucia and that if i saw a comic shooting in chicote s during the war i could write about it just as though it had been in new york chicago key west or marseilles it did not have anything to do with politics she said i shouldn t probably a lot of other people will say i shouldn t too the german seemed to think it was a pretty good story however and i gave him the last of the camels well anyway finally after about three hours the police said we could go they were sort of worried about me at the florida because in those days with the shelling if you started for home on foot and didn t get there after the bars were closed at seven thirty people worried i was glad to get home and i told the story while we were cooking supper on an electric stove and it had quite a success well it stopped raining during the night and the next morning it was a fine bright cold early winter day and at twelve forty five i pushed open the revolving doors at chicote s to try a little gin and tonic before lunch there were very few people there at that hour and two waiters and the manager came over to the table they were all smiling did they catch the murderer i asked don t make jokes so early in the day the manager said did you see him shot yes i told him me too he said i was just here when it happened he pointed to a comer table he placed the pistol right against the man s chest when he fired how late did they hold people oh until past two this morning they only came for the fiambre using the spanish slang word for corpse the same used on menus for cold meat at eleven o clock this morning but you don t know about it yet the manager said no he doesn t know a waiter said it is a very rare thing another waiter said muy raro and sad too the manager said he shook his head yes sad and curious the waiter said very sad tell me it is a very rare thing the manager said tell me come on tell me the manager leaned over the table in great confidence in the flit gun you know he said he had eau de cologne poor fellow it was not a joke in such bad taste you see the waiter said it was really just gaiety no one should have taken offense the manager said poor fellow i see i said he just wanted everyone to have a good time yes said the manager it was really just an unfortunate misunderstanding and what about the flit gun the police took it they have sent it around to his family i imagine they will be glad to have it i said yes said the manager certainly a flit gun is always useful who was he a cabinet maker married yes the wife was here with the police this morning what did she say she dropped down by him and said pedro what have they done to thee pedro who has done this to thee oh pedro then the police had to take her away because she could not control herself the waiter said it seems he was feeble of the chest the manager said he fought in the first days of the movement they said he fought in the sierra but he was too weak in the chest to continue and yesterday afternoon he just went out on the town to cheer things up i suggested no said the manager you see it is very rare everything is muy raro this i learn from the police who are very efficient if given time they have interrogated comrades from the shop where he worked this they located from the card of his syndicate which was in his pocket yesterday he bought the flit gun and agua de colonia to use for a joke at a wedding he had announced this intention he bought them across the street there was a label on the cologne bottle with the address the bottle was in the washroom it was there he filled the flit gun after buying them he must have come in here when the rain started i remember when he came in a waiter said in the gaiety with the singing he became gay too he was gay all right i said he was practically floating around the manager kept on with the relentless spanish logic that is the gaiety of drinking with a weakness of the chest he said i don t like this story very well i said listen said the manager how rare it is his gaiety comes in contact with the seriousness of the war like a butterfly oh very like a butterfly i said too much like a butterfly i am not joking said the manager you see it like a butterfly and a tank this pleased him enormously he was getting into the real spanish metaphysics have a drink on the house he said you must write a story about this i remembered the flit gun man with his grey wax hands and his grey wax face his arms spread wide and his legs drawn up and he did look a little like a butterfly not too much you know but he did not look very human either he reminded me more of a dead sparrow i ll take gin and schweppes quinine tonic water i said you must write a story about it the manager said here here s luck luck i said look an english girl last night told me i shouldn t write about it that it would be very bad for the cause what nonsense the manager said it is very interesting and important the misunderstood gaiety coming in contact with the deadly seriousness that is here always to me it is the rarest and most interesting thing which i have seen for some time you must write it all right i said sure has he any children no he said i asked the police but you must write it and you must call it the butterfly and the tank all right i said sure but i don t like the title much the title is very elegant the manager said it is pure literature all right i said sure that s what we ll call it the butterfly and the tank and i sat there on that bright cheerful morning the place smelling clean and newly aired and swept with the manager who was an old friend and who was now very pleased with the literature we were making together and i took a sip of the gin and tonic water and looked out the sandbagged window and thought of the wife kneeling there and saying pedro pedro who has done this to thee pedro and i thought that the police would never be able to tell her that even if they had the name of the man who pulled the trigger night before battle at this time we were working in a shell smashed house that overlooked the casa del campo in madrid below us a battle was being fought you could see it spread out below you and over the hills could smell it could taste the dust of it and the noise of it was one great slithering sheet of rifle and automatic rifle fire rising and dropping and in it came the crack of the guns and the bubbly rumbling of the outgoing shells fired from the batteries behind us the thud of their bursts and then the rolling yellow clouds of dust but it was just too far to film well we had tried working closer but they kept sniping at the camera and you could not work the big camera was the most expensive thing we had and if it was smashed we were through we were making the film on almost nothing and all the money was in the cans of film and the cameras we could not afford to waste film and you had to be awfully careful of the cameras the day before we had been sniped out of a good place to film from and i had to crawl back holding the small camera to my belly trying to keep my head lower than my shoulders hitching along on my elbows the bullets whocking into the brick wall over my back and twice spurting dirt over me our heaviest attacks were made in the afternoon god knows why as the fascists then had the sun at their backs and it shone on the camera lenses and made them blink like a helio and the moors would open up on the flash they knew all about helios and officers glasses from the riff and if you wanted to be properly sniped all you had to do was use a pair of glasses without shading them adequately they could shoot too and they had kept my mouth dry all day in the afternoon we moved up into the house it was a fine place to work and we made a son of a blind for the camera on a balcony with the broken latticed curtains but as i said it was too far it was not too far to get the pine studded hillside the lake and the outline of the stone farm buildings that disappeared in the sudden smashes of stone dust from the hits by high explosive shells nor was it too far to get the clouds of smoke and dirt that thundered up on the hill crest as the bombers droned over but at eight hundred to a thousand yards the tanks looked like small mud colored beetles bustling in the trees and spitting tiny flashes and the men behind them were toy men who lay flat then crouched and ran and then dropped to run again or to stay where they lay spotting the hillside as the tanks moved on still we hoped to get the shape of the battle we had many close shots and would get others with luck and if we could get the sudden fountainings of earth the puffs of shrapnel the rolling louds of smoke and dust lit by the yellow flash and white blossoming of grenades that is the very shape of battle we would have something that we needed so when the light failed we carried the big camera down the stairs took off the tripod made three loads and then one at a time sprinted across the fire swept corner of the paseo rosales into the lee of the stone wall of the stables of the old montana barracks we knew we had a good place to work and we felt cheerful but we were kidding ourselves plenty that it was not too far come on let s go to chicote s i said when we had come up the hill to the hotel florida but they had to repair a camera to change film and seal up what we had made so i went alone you were never alone in spain and it felt good for a change as i started to walk down the gran via to chicote s in the april twilight i felt happy cheerful and excited we had worked hard and i thought well but walking down the street alone all my elation died now that i was alone and there was no excitement i knew we had been too far away and any fool could see the offensive was a failure i had known it all day but you are often deceived by hope and optimism but remembering how it looked now i knew this was just another blood bath like the somme the people s army was on the offensive finally but it was attacking in a way that could do only one thing destroy itself and as i put together now what i had seen all day and what i had heard i felt plenty bad i knew in the smoke and din of chicote s that the offensive was a failure and i knew it even stronger when i took my first drink at the crowded bar when things are all right and it is you that is feeling low a drink can make you feel better but when things are really bad and you are all right a drink just makes it clearer now in chicote s it was so crowded that you had to make room with your elbows to get your drink to your mouth i had one good long swallow and then someone jostled me so that i spilled pan of the glass of whisky and soda i looked around angrily and the man who had jostled me laughed hello fish face he said hello you goat let s get a table he said you certainly looked sore when i bumped you where did you come from i asked his leather coat was dirty and greasy his eyes were hollow and he needed a shave he had the big colt automatic that had belonged to three other men that i had known of and that we were always trying to get shells for strapped to his leg he was very tall and his face was smoke darkened and grease smudged he had a leather helment with a heavy leather padded ridge longitudinally over the top and a heavily padded leather rim where d you come from casa del campo he said pronouncing it in a sing song mocking way we had heard a page boy use in calling in the lobby of a hotel in new orleans one time and still kept as a private joke there s a table i said as two soldiers and two girls got up to go let s get it we sat at this table in the middle of the room and i watched him raise his glass his hands were greasy and the forks of both thumbs black as graphite from the back spit of the machine gun the hand holding the drink was shaking look at them he put out the other hand it was shaking too both the same he said in that same comic lilt then seriously you been down there we re making a picture of it photograph well not too see us where attack on the farm three twenty five this afternoon oh yes like it nope me either he said listen the whole thing is just as crazy as a bedbug why do they want to make a frontal attack against positions like those who in hell thought it up an s o b named largo caballero said a short man with thick glasses who was sitting at the table when we came over to it the first time they let him look through a pair of field glasses he became a general this is his masterpiece we both looked at the man who spoke al wagner the tank man looked at me and raised what had been his eyebrows before they were burnt off the little man smiled at us if anyone around here speaks english you re liable to get shot comrade al said to him no said the little short man largo caballero is liable to be shot he ought to be shot listen comrade said al just speak a little quieter will you somebody might overhear you and think we were with you i know what i m talking about said the short man with the very thick glasses i looked at him carefully he gave you a certain feeling that he did just the same it isn t always a good thing to say what you know i said have a drink certainly he said it s all right to talk to you i know you you re all right i m not that all right i said and this is a public bar a public bar is the only private place there is nobody can hear what we say here what is your unit comrade i ve got some tanks about eight minutes from here on foot al told him we are through for the day and i have the early part of this evening off why don t you ever get washed i said i plan to said al in your room when we leave here have you got any mechanic s soap no that s all right he said i ve got a little here with me in my pocket that i ve been saving the little man with the thick lensed glasses was looking at al intently are you a party member comrade he asked sure said al i know comrade henry here is not the little man said i wouldn t trust him then al said i never do you bastid i said want to go no al said i need another drink very badly i know all about comrade henry the little man said now let me tell you something more about largo caballero do we have to hear it al asked remember i m in the people s army you don t think it will discourage me do you you know his head is swelled so badly now he s getting sort of mad he is prime minister and war minister and nobody can even talk to him any more you know he s just a good honest trade union leader somewhere between the late sam gompers and john l lewis but this man araquistain who invented him take it easy said al i don t follow oh araquistain invented him araquistain who is ambassador in paris now he made him up you know he called him the spanish lenin and then the poor man tried to live up to it and somebody let him look through a pair of field glasses and he thought he was clausewitz you said that before al told him coldly what do you base it on why three days ago in the cabinet meeting he was talking about military affairs they were talking about this business we ve got now and jesus hernandez just ribbing him you know asked him what was the difference between tactics and strategy do you know what the old boy said no al said i could see this new comrade was getting a little on his nerves he said in tactics you attack the enemy from in front in strategy you take him from the sides now isn t that something you better run along comrade al said you re getting so awfully discouraged but we ll get rid of largo caballero the short comrade said we ll get rid of him right after his offensive this last piece of stupidity will be the end of him o k comrade al told him but i ve got to attack in the morning oh you are going to attack again listen comrade you can tell me any sort of crap you want because it s interesting and i m grown up enough to sort things out but don t ask me any questions see because you ll be in trouble i just meant it personally not as information we don t know each other well enough to ask personal questions comrade al said why don t you just go to another table and let comrade henry and me talk i want to ask him some things salud comrade the little man said standing up we ll meet another time good said al another time we watched him go over to another table he excused himself some soldiers made room for him and as we watched we could see him starting to talk they all looked interested what do you make of that little guy al asked i don t know me either al said he certainly had this offensive sized up he took a drink and showed his hand see it s all right now i m not any rummy either i never take a drink before an attack how was it today you saw it how did it look terrible that s it that s the word for it all right it was terrible i guess he s using strategy and tactics both now because we are attacking from straight in front and from both sides how s the rest of it going duran took the new race track the hipódromo we ve narrowed down on the corridor that runs up into university city up above we crossed the coruña road and we re stopped at the cerro de aguilar since yesterday morning we were up that way this morning duran lost over half his brigade i heard how is it with you tomorrow we re going to try those farm houses and the church again the church on the hill the one they call the hermit is the objective the whole hillside is cut by those gullies and it s all enfiladed at least three ways by machine gun posts they re dug deep all through there and it s well done we haven t got enough artillery to give any kind of real covering fire to keep them down and we haven t heavy artillery to blow them out they ve got anti tanks in those three houses and an antitank battery by the church it s going to be murder when s it for don t ask me i ve got no right to tell you that if we have to film it i meant i said the money from the film all goes for ambulances we ve got the twelfth brigade in the counter attack at the argada bridge and we ve got the twelfth again in that attack last week by pingarron we got some good tank shots there the tanks were no good there al said i know i said but they photographed very well what about tomorrow just get out early and wait he said not too early how you feel now i m awfully tired he said and i ve got a bad headache but i feel a lot better let s have another one and then go up to your place and get a bath maybe we ought to eat first i m too dirty to eat you can hold a place and i ll go get a bath and join you at the gran via i ll go up with you no it s better to hold a place and i ll join you he leaned his head forward on the table boy i got a headache it s the noise in those buckets i never hear it any more but it does something to your ears just the same why don t you go to bed no i d rather stay up with you for a while and then sleep when i got back down there i don t want to wake up twice you haven t got the horrors have you no he said i m fine listen hank i don t want to talk a lot of crap but i think i m going to get killed tomorrow i touched the table three times with my fingertips everybody feels like that i ve felt like that plenty of times no he said it s not natural with me but where we ve got to go tomorrow doesn t make sense i don t even know that i can get them up there you can t make them move if they won t go you can shoot them afterwards but at the time if they won t go they won t go if you shoot them they still won t go maybe it will be all right no we ve got good infantry tomorrow they ll go anyway not like those yellow bastids we had the first day maybe it will be all right no he said it won t be all right but it will be just exactly as good as i can make it i can make them start all right and i can take them up to where they will have to quit one at a time maybe they can make it i ve got three i can rely on if only one of the good ones doesn t get knocked out at the start who are your good ones i ve got a big greek from chicago that will go anywhere he s just as good as they come i ve got a frenchman from marseille that s got his left shoulder in a cast with two wounds still draining that asked to come out of the hospital in the palace hotel for this show and has to be strapped in and i don t know how he can do it just technically i mean he d break your bloody heart he used to be a taxi driver he stopped i m talking too much stop me if i talk too much who s the third one i asked the third one did i say i had a third one sure oh yes he said that s me what about the others they re mechanics but they couldn t learn to soldier they can t size up what s happening and they re all afraid to die i tried to get them over it he said but it comes back on them every attack they look like tank men when you see them by the tanks with the helmets on they look like tank men when they get in but when they shut the traps down there s really nothing inside they aren t tank men and so far we haven t had time to make new ones do you want to take the bath let s sit here a little while longer he said it s nice here it s funny all right with a war right down the end of the street so you can walk to it and then leave it and come here and then walk back to it al said what about a girl there s two american girls at the florida newspaper correspondents maybe you could make one i don t want to have to talk to them i m too tired there s the two moor girls from ceuta at that corner table he looked over at them they were both dark and bushy headed one was large and one was small and they certainly both looked strong and active no said al i m going to see plenty moors tomorrow without having to fool with them tonight there s plenty of girls i said manolita s at the florida that seguridad bird she lives with has gone to valencia and she s being true to him with everybody listen hank what are you trying to promote me i just wanted to cheer you up grow up he said what s one more one more i don t mind dying a bit he said dying is just a lot of crap only it s wasteful the attack is wrong and it s wasteful i can handle tanks good now if i had time i could make good tankists too and if we had tanks that were a little bit faster the anti tanks wouldn t bother them the way it does when you haven t got the mobility listen hank they aren t what we thought they were though do you remember when everybody thought if we only had tanks they were good at gaudalajara sure but those were the old boys they were soldiers and it was against italians but what s happened a lot of things the mercenaries signed up for six months most of them were frenchmen they soldiered good for five but now all they want to do is live through the last month and go home they aren t worth a damn now the russians that came out as demonstrators when the government bought the tanks were perfect but they re pulling them back now for china they say the new spaniards are some of them good and some not it takes six months to make a good tank man i mean to know anything and to be able to size up and work intelligently you have to have a talent we ve been having to make them in six weeks and there aren t so many with a talent they make fine flyers they ll make fine tank guys too but you have to get the ones with a vocation for it it s sort of like being a priest you have to be cut out for it especially now they ve got so much anti tank they had pulled down the shutters in chicote s and now they were locking the door no one would be allowed in now but you had a half an hour more before they closed i like it here said al it isn t so noisy now remember that time i met you in new orleans when i was on a ship and we went in to have a drink in the monteleone bar and that kid that looked just like saint sebastian was paging people with that funny voice like he was singing and i gave him a quarter to page mr b f slob that s the same way you said casa del campo yeah he said i laugh every time i think of that then he went on you see now they re not frightened of tanks any more nobody is we aren t either but they re still useful really useful only with the anti tank now they re so damn vulnerable maybe i ought to be in something else not really because they re still useful but the way they are now you ve got to have a vocation for them you got to have a lot of political development to be a good tank man now you re a good tank man i d like to be something else tomorrow he said i m talking awfully wet but you have a right to talk wet if it isn t going to hurt anybody else you know i like tanks too only we don t use them right because the infantry don t know enough yet they just want the old tank ahead to give them some cover while they go that s no good then they get to depending on the tanks and they won t move without them sometimes they won t even deploy i know but you see if you had tankists that knew their stuff they d go out ahead and develop the machine gun fire and then drop back behind the infantry and fire on the gun and knock it out and give the infantry covering fire when they attacked and other tanks could rush the machine gun posts as though they were cavalry and they could straddle a trench and enfilade and put flaking fire down it and they could bring up infantry when it was right to or cover their advance when that was best but instead instead it s like it will be tomorrow we have so damned few guns that we re just used as slightly mobile armored artillery units and as soon as you are standing still and being light artillery you ve lost your mobility and that s your safety and they start sniping at you with the anti tanks and if we re not that we re just sort of iron perambulators to push ahead of the infantry and lately you don t know whether the perambulator will push or whether the guys inside will push them and you never know if there s going to be anybody behind you when you get there how many are you now to a brigade six to a battalion thirty to a brigade that s in principle why don t you come along now and get the bath and we ll go and eat all right but don t you start taking care of me or thinking i m worried or anything because i m not i m just tired and i wanted to talk and don t give me any pep talk either because we ve got a political commissar and i know what i m fighting for and i m not worried but i d like things to be efficient and used as intelligently as possible what made you think i was going to give you any pep talk you started to look like it all i tried to do was see if you wanted a girl and not to talk too wet about getting killed well i don t want any girl tonight and i ll talk just as wet as i please unless it does damage to others does it damage you come on and get the bath i said you can talk just as bloody wet as you want who do you suppose that little guy was that talked as though he knew so much i don t know i said but i m going to find out he made me gloomy said al come on let s go the old waiter with the bald head unlocked the outside door of chicote s and let us out into the street how is the offensive comrades he said at the door it s o k comrade said al it s all right i am happy said the waiter my boy is in the one hundred and forty fifth brigade have you seen them i am of the tanks said al this comrade makes a cinema have you seen the hundred and forty fifth no i said they are up the extremadura road the old waiter said my boy is political commissar of the machine gun company of his battalion he is my youngest boy he is twenty what party are you comrade al asked him i am of no party the waiter said but my boy is a communist so am i said al the offensive comrade has not yet reached a decision it is very difficult the fascists hold very strong positions you in the rear guard must be as firm as we will be at the front we may not take these positions now but we have proved we now have an army capable of going on the offensive and you will see what it will do and the extremadura road asked the old waiter still holding on to the door is it very dangerous there no said al it s fine up there you don t need to worry about him up there god bless you said the waiter god guard you and keep you outside in the dark street al said jees he s kind of confused politically isn t he he is a good guy i said i ve known him for a long time he seems like a good guy al said but he ought to get wise to himself politically the room at the florida was crowded they were playing the gramophone and it was full of smoke and there was a crap game going on the floor comrades kept coming in to use the bathtub and the room smelt of smoke soap dirty uniforms and steam from the bathroom the spanish girl called manolita very neat demurely dressed with a sort of false french chic with much joviality much dignity and closely set cold eyes was sitting on the bed talking with an english newspaper man except for the gramophone it wasn t very noisy it is your room isn t it the english newspaper man said it s in my name at the desk i said i sleep in it sometimes but whose is the whisky he asked mine said manolita they drank that bottle so i got another you re a good girl daughter i said that s three i owe you two she said the other was a present there was a huge cooked ham rosy and white edged in a half opened tin on the table beside my typewriter and a comrade would reach up cut himself a slice of ham with his pocket knife and go back to the crap game i cut myself a slice of ham you re next on the tub i said to al he had been looking around the room it s nice here he said where did the ham come from we bought it from the intendencia of one of the brigades she said isn t it beautiful who s we he and i she said turning her head toward the english correspondent don t you think he s cute manolita has been most kind said the englishman i hope we re not disturbing you not at all i said later on i might want to use the bed but that won t be until much later we can have a party in my room manolita said you aren t cross are you henry never i said who are the comrades shooting craps i don t know said manolita they came in for baths and then they stayed to shoot craps everyone has been very nice you know my bad news no it s very bad you knew my fiancé who was in the police and went to barcelona yes sure al went into the bathroom well he was shot in an accident and i haven t any one i can depend on in police circles and he never got me the papers he had promised me and today i heard i was going to be arrested why because i have no papers and they say i hang around with you people and with people from the brigades all the time so i am probably a spy if my fiancé had not gotten himself shot it would have been all right will you help me sure i said nothing will happen to you if you re all right i think i d better stay with you to be sure and if you re not all right that would be fine for me wouldn t it can t i stay with you no if you get in trouble call me up i never heard you ask anybody any military questions i think you re all right i m really all right she said then leaning over away from the englishman you think it s all right to stay with him is he all right how do i know i said i never saw him before you re being cross she said let s not think about it now but everyone be happy and go out to dinner i went over to the crap game you want to go out to dinner no comrade said the man handling the dice without looking up you want to get in the game i want to eat we ll be here when you get back said another crap shooter come on roll i ve got you covered if you run into any money bring it up here to the game there was one in the room i knew besides manolita he was from the twelfth brigade and he was playing the gramophone he was a hungarian a sad hungarian not one of the cheerful kind salud camarade he said thank you for your hospitality don t you shoot craps i asked him i haven t that sort of money he said they are aviators with contracts mercenaries they make a thousand dollars a month they were on the teruel front and now they have come here how did they come up here one of them knows you but he had to go out to his field they came for him in a car and the game had already started i m glad you came up i said come up any time and make yourself at home i came to play the new discs he said it does not disturb you no it s fine have a drink a little ham he said one of the crap shooters reached up and cut a slice of ham you haven t seen this guy henry around that owns the place have you he asked me that s me oh he said sorry want to get in the game later on i said o k he said then his mouth full of ham listen you tar heel bastid make your dice hit the wall and bounce won t make no difference to you comrade said the man handling the dice al came out of the bathroom he looked all clean except for some smudges around his eyes you can take those off with a towel i said what look at yourself once more in the mirror it s too steamy he said to hell with it i feel clean let s eat i said come on manolita you know each other i watched her eyes run over al how are you manolita said i say that is a sound idea the englishman said do let s eat but where is that a crap game al said didn t you see it when you came in no he said all i saw was the ham it s a crap game you go and eat al said i m staying here as we went out there were six of them on the floor and al wagner was reaching up to cut a slice of ham what do you do comrade i heard one of the flyers say to al tanks tell me they aren t any good any more said the flyer tell you a lot of things al said what you got there some dice want to look at them no said al i want to handle them we went down the hall manolita me and the tall englishman and found the boys had left already for the gran via restaurant the hungarian had stayed behind to replay the new discs i was very hungry and the food at the gran via was lousy the two who were making the film had already eaten and gone back to work on the bad camera this restaurant was in the basement and you had to pass a guard and go through the kitchen and down a stairs to get to it it was a racket they had a millet and water soup yellow rice with horse meat in it and oranges for dessert there had been another dish of chickpeas with sausage in it that everybody said was terrible but it had run out the newspaper men all sat at one table and the other tables were filled with officers and girls from chicote s people from the censorship which was then in the telephone building across the street and various unknown citizens the restaurant was run by an anarchist syndicate and they sold you wine that was all stamped with the label of the royal cellars and the date it had been put in the bins most of it was so old that it was either corked or just plain faded out and gone to pieces you can t drink labels and i sent three bottles back as bad before we got a drinkable one there was a row about this the waiters didn t know the different wines they just brought you a bottle of wine and you took your chances they were as different from the chicote s waiters as black from white these waiters were all snotty all over tipped and they regularly had special dishes such as lobster or chicken that they sold extra for gigantic prices but these had all been bought up before we got there so we just drew the soup the rice and the oranges the place always made me angry because the waiters were a crooked lot of profiteers and it was about as expensive to eat in if you had one of the special dishes as 21 or the colony in new york we were sitting at the table with a bottle of wine that just wasn t bad you know you could taste it starting to go but it wouldn t justify making a row about when al wagner came in he looked around the room saw us and came over what s the matter i said they broke me he said it didn t take very long not with those guys he said that s a big game what have they got to eat i called a waiter over it s too late he said we can t serve anything now this comrade is in the tanks i said he has fought all day and he will fight tomorrow and he hasn t eaten that s not my fault the waiter said it s too late there isn t anything more why doesn t the comrade eat with his unit the army has plenty of food i asked him to eat with me you should have said something about it it s too late now we are not serving anything any more get the head waiter the headwaiter said the cook had gone home and there was no fire in the kitchen he went away they were angry because we had sent the bad wine back the hell with it said al let s go somewhere else there s no place you can eat at this hour they ve got food i ll just have to go over and suck up to the headwaiter and give him some more money i went over and did just that and the sullen waiter brought a plate of cold sliced meats then half a spiny lobster with mayonnaise and a salad of lettuce and lentils the headwaiter sold this out of his private stock which he was holding out either to take home or sell to late comers cost you much al asked no i lied i ll bet it did he said i ll fix up with you when i get paid what do you get now i don t know yet it was ten pesetas a day but they ve raised it now i m an officer but we haven t got it yet and i haven t asked comrade i called the waiter he came over still angry that the headwaiter had gone over his head and served al bring another bottle of wine please what kind any that is not too old so that the red is faded it s all the same i said the equivalent of like hell it is in spanish and the waiter brought over a bottle of château mouton rothschild 1906 that was just as good as the last claret we had was rotten boy that s wine al said what did you tell him to get that nothing he just made a lucky draw out of the bin most of that stuff from the palace stinks it s too old this is a hell of a climate on wine there s that wise comrade al nodded across at another table the little man with the thick glasses that had talked to us about largo caballero was talking with some people i knew were very big shots indeed i guess he s a big shot i said when they re high enough up they don t give a damn what they say but i wish he would have waited until after tomorrow it s kind of spoiled tomorrow for me i filled his glass what he said sounded pretty sensible al went on i ve been thinking it over but my duty is to do what i m ordered to do don t worry about it and get some sleep i m going to get in that game again if you ll let me take a thousand pesetas al said i ve got a lot more than that coming to me and i ll give you an order on my pay i don t want any order you can pay me when you get it i don t think i m going to draw it al said i certainly sound wet don t i and i know gambling s bohemianism too but in a game like that is the only time i don t think about tomorrow did you like that manolita girl she liked you she s got eyes like a snake she s not a bad girl she s friendly and she s all right i don t want any girl i want to get back in that crap game down the table manolita was laughing at something the new englishman had said in spanish most of the people had left the table let s finish the wine and go al said don t you want to get in that game i ll watch you for a while i said and called the waiter over to bring us the bill where you go manolita called down the table to the room we come by later on she said this man is very funny she is making most awful sport of me the englishman said she picks up on my errors in spanish i say doesn t leche mean milk that s one interpretation of it does it mean something beastly too i m afraid so i said you know it is a beastly language he said now manolita stop pulling my leg i say stop it i m not pulling your leg manolita laughed i never touched your leg i am just laughing about the leche but it does mean milk didn t you just hear edwin henry say so manolita started to laugh again and we got up to go he s a silly piece of work al said i d almost like to take her away because he s so silly you can never tell about an englishman i said it was such a profound remark that i knew we had ordered too many bottles outside in the street it was turning cold and in the moonlight the clouds were passing very big and white across the wide building sided canyon of the gran via and we walked up the sidewalk with the day s fresh shell holes neatly cut in the cement their rubble still not swept away on up the rise of the hill toward the plaza callao where the florida hotel faced down the other little hill where the wide street ran that ended at the front we went past the two guards in the dark outside the door of the hotel and listened a minute in the doorway as the shooting down the street strengthened into a roll of firing then dropped off if it keeps up i guess i ought to go down al said listening that wasn t anything i said anyway that was off to the left by carabanchel it sounded straight down in the campo that s the way the sound throws here at night it always fools you they aren t going to counterattack us tonight al said when they ve got those positions and we are up that creek they aren t going to leave their positions to try to kick us out of that creek what creek you know the name of that creek oh that creek yeah up that creek without a paddle come on inside you didn t have to listen to that firing that s the way it is every night we went inside crossed the lobby passing the night watchman at the concierge s desk and the night watchman got up and went with us to the elevator he pushed a button and the elevator came down in it was a man with a white curly sheep s wool jacket the wool worn inside a pink bald head and a pink angry face he had six bottles of champagne under his arms and in his hands and he said what the hell s the idea of bringing the elevator down you ve been riding in the elevator for an hour the night watchman said i can t help it said the wooly jacket man then to me where s frank frank who you know frank he said come on help me with this elevator you re drunk i said to him come on skip it and let us get upstairs so would you be drunk said the white woolly jacket man so would you be drunk comrade old comrade listen where s frank where do you think he is in this fellow henry s room where the crap game is come on with us i said don t fool with those buttons that s why you stop it all the time i can fly anything said the woolly jacket man and i can fly this old elevator want me to stunt it skip it al said to him you re drunk we want to get to the crap game who are you i ll hit you with a bottle full of champagne wine try it said al i d like to cool you you rummy fake santa claus a rummy fake santa claus said the bald man a rummy fake santa claus and that s the thanks of the republic we had gotten the elevator stopped at my floor and were walking down the hall take some bottles said the bald man then do you know why i m drunk no well i won t tell you but you d be surprised a rummy fake santa claus well well well what are you in comrade tanks and you comrade making a picture and i m a rummy fake santa claus well well well i repeat well well well go and drown in it said al you rummy fake santa claus we were outside the room now the man in the white woolly coat took hold of al s arm with his thumb and forefinger you amuse me comrade he said you truly amuse me i opened the door the room was full of smoke and the game looked just as when we had left it except the ham was all gone off the table and the whisky all gone out of the bottle it s baldy said one of the crap shooters how do you do comrades said baldy bowing how do you do how do you do how do you do the game broke up and they all started to shoot questions at him i have made my report comrades baldy said and here is a little champagne wine i am no longer interested in any but the picturesque aspects of the whole affair where did your wingmen muck off to it wasn t their fault said baldy i was engaged in contemplating a terrific spectacle and i was ob livious of the fact that i had any wingmen until all of those fiats started coming down over past and under me and i realized that my trusty little air o plane no longer had any tail jees i wish you weren t drunk said one of the flyers but i am drunk said baldy and i hope all you gentlemen and comrades will join me because i am very happy tonight even though i have been insulted by an ignorant tank man who has called me a rummy fake santa claus i wish you were sober the other flyer said how d you get back to the field don t ask me any questions baldy said with great dignity i returned in a staff car of the twelfth brigade when i alighted with my trusty para chute there was a tendency to regard me as a criminal fascist due to my inability to master the lanish spanguage but all difficulties were smoothed away when i convinced them of my identity and i was treated with rare consideration oh boy you ought to have seen that junker when she started to burn that s what i was watching when the fiats dove on me oh boy i wish i could tell you he shot a tri moter junker down today over the jarama and his wingmen mucked off on him and he got shot down and bailed out one of the flyers said you know him baldy jackson how far did you drop before you pulled your rip cord baldy asked another flyer all of six thousand feet and i think my diaphragm is busted loose in front from when she came taut i thought it would cut me in two there must have been fifteen fiats and i wanted to get completely clear i had to fool with the chute plenty to get down on the right side of the river i had to slip her plenty and i hit pretty hard the wind was good frank had to go back to alcalá another flyer said we started a crap game we got to get back there before daylight i am in no mood to toy with the dice said baldy i am in a mood to drink champagne wine out of glasses with cigarette butts in them i ll wash them said al for comrade fake santa claus said baldy for old comrade claus skip it said al he picked up the glasses and took them to the bathroom is he in the tanks asked one of the flyers yes he s been there since the start they tell me the tanks aren t any good any more a flyer said you told him that once i said why don t you lay off he s been working all day so have we but i mean really they aren t any good are they not so good but he s good i guess he s all right he looks like a nice fellow what kind of money do they make they got ten pesetas a day i said now he gets a lieutenant s pay spanish lieutenant yes i guess he s nuts all right or has he got politics he s got politics oh well he said that explains it say baldy you must have had a hell of a time bailing out with that wind pressure with the tail gone yes comrade said baldy how did you feel i was thinking all the time comrade baldy how many bailed out of the junker four said baldy out of a crew of six i was sure i d killed the pilot i noticed when he quit firing there s a co pilot that s a gunner too and i m pretty sure i got him too i must have because he quit firing too but maybe it was the heat anyhow four came out would you like me to describe the scene i can describe the scene very well he was sitting on the bed now with a large water glass of champagne in his hand and his pink head and pink face were moist with sweat why doesn t anyone drink to me asked baldy i would like all comrades to drink to me and then i will describe the scene in all its horror and its beauty we all drank where was i asked baldy just coming out of the mcalester hotel a flyer said in all your horror and your beauty don t clown baldy oddly enough we re interested i will describe it said baldy but first i must have more champagne wine he had drained the glass when we drank to him if he drinks like that he ll go to sleep another flyer said only give him half a glass baldy drank it off i will describe it he said after another little drink listen baldy take it easy will you this is something we want to get straight you got no ship now for a few days but we re flying tomorrow and this is important as well as interesting i made my report said baldy you can read it out at the field they ll have a copy come on baldy snap out of it i will describe it eventually said baldy he shut and opened his eyes several times then said hello comrade santa claus to al i will describe it eventually all you comrades have to do is listen and he described it it was very strange and very beautiful baldy said and drank off the glass of champagne cut it out baldy a flyer said i have experienced profound emotions baldy said highly profound emotions emotions of the deepest dye let s get back to alcalá one flyer said that pink head isn t going to make sense what about the game he s going to make sense another flyer said he s just winding up are you criticizing me asked baldy is that the thanks of the republic listen santa claus al said what was it like are you asking me baldy stared at him are you putting questions to me have you ever been in action comrade no said al i got these eyebrows burnt off when i was shaving keep your drawers on comrade said baldy i will describe the strange and beautiful scene i m a writer you know as well as a flyer he nodded his head in confirmation of his own statement he writes for the meridian mississippi argus said a flyer all the time they can t stop him i have talent as a writer said baldy i have a fresh and original talent for description i have a newspaper clipping which i have lost which says so now i will launch myself on the description o k what did it look like comrades said baldy you can t describe it he held out his glass what did i tell you said a flyer he couldn t make sense in a month he never could make sense you said baldy you unfortunate little fellow all right when i banked out of it i looked down and of course she had been pouring back smoke but she was holding right on her course to get over the mountains she was losing altitude fast and i came up and over and dove on her again there were still wingmen then and she d lurched and started to smoke twice as much and then the door of the cockpit came open and it was just like looking into a blast furnace and then they started to come out i d half rolled dove and then pulled up out of it and i was looking back and down and they were coming out of her out through the blast furnace door dropping out trying to get clear and the chutes opened up and they looked like great big beautiful morning glories opening up and she was just one big thing of flame now like you never saw and going round and round and there were four chutes just as beautiful as anything you could see just pulling slow against the sky and then one started to burn at the edge and as it burned the man started to drop fast and i was watching him when the bullets started to come by and the fiats right behind them and the bullets and the fiats you re a writer all right said one flyer you ought to write for war aces do you mind telling me in plain language what happened no said baldy i ll tell you but you know no kidding it was something to see and i never shot down any big tri motor junkers before and i m happy everybody s happy baldy tell us what happened really o k said baldy i ll just drink a little wine and then i ll tell you how were you when you sighted them we were in a left echelon of v s then we went into a left echelon of echelons and dove onto them with all four guns until you could have touched them before we rolled out of it we crippled three others the fiats were hanging up in the sun they didn t come down until i was sightseeing all by myself did your wingmen muck off no it was my fault i started watching the spectacle and they were gone there isn t any formation for watching spectacles i guess they went on and picked up the echelon i don t know don t ask me and i m tired i was elated but now i m tired you re sleepy you mean you re rum dumb and sleepy i am simply tired said baldy a man in my position has the right to be tired and if i become sleepy i have the right to be sleepy don t i santa claus he said to al yeah said al i guess you have the right to be sleepy i m even sleepy

he went out if you hadn t known him pretty well and if you hadn t seen the terrain where he was going to attack tomorrow you would have thought he was very angry about something i guess somewhere inside of himself he was angry very angry you get angry about a lot of things and you yourself dying uselessly is one of them but then i guess angry is about the best way that you can be when you attack under the ridge in the heat of the day with the dust blowing we came back dry mouthed nose clogged and heavy loaded down out of the battle to the long ridge above the river where the spanish troops lay in reserve i sat down with my back against the shallow trench my shoulders and the back of my head against the earth clear now from even stray bullets and looked at what lay below us in the hollow there was the tank reserve the tanks covered with branches chopped from olive trees to their left were the staff cars mud daubed and branch covered and between the two a long line of men carrying stretchers wound down through the gap to where on the flat at the foot of the ridge ambulances were loading commissary mules loaded with sacks of bread and kegs of wine and a train of ammunition mules led by their drivers were coming up the gap in the ridge and men with empty stretchers were walking slowly up the trail with the mules to the right below the curve of the ridge i could see the entrance to the cave where the brigade staff was working and their signaling wires ran out of the top of the cave and curved on over the ridge in the shelter of which we lay motorcyclists in leather suits and helmets came up and down the cut on their cycles or where it was too steep walking them and leaving them beside the cut walked over to the entrance to the cave and ducked inside as i watched a big hungarian cyclist that i knew came out of the cave tucked some papers in his leather wallet walked over to his motorcycle and pushing it up through the stream of mules and stretcher bearers threw a leg over the saddle and roared on over the ridge his machine churning a storm of dust below across the flat where the ambulances were coming and going was the green foliage that marked the line of the river there was a large house with a red tile roof and there was a gray stone mill and from the trees around the big house beyond the river came the flashes of our guns they were firing straight at us and there were the twin flashes then the throaty short bung bung of the three inch pieces and then the rising cry of the shells coming toward us and going on over our heads as always we were short of artillery there were only four batteries down there when there should have been forty and they were firing only two guns at a time the attack had failed before we came down are you russians a spanish soldier asked me no americans i said have you any water yes comrade he handed over a pigskin bag these troops in reserve were soldiers only in name and from the fact that they were in uniform they were not intended to be used in the attack and they sprawled along this line under the crest of the ridge huddled in groups eating drinking and talking or simply sitting dumbly waiting the attack was being made by an international brigade we both drank the water tasted of asphalt and pig bristles wine is better the soldier said i will get wine yes but for the thirst water there is no thirst like the thirst of battle even here in reserve i have much thirst that is fear said another soldier thirst is fear no said another with fear there is thirst always but in battle there is much thirst even when there is no fear there is always fear in battle said the first soldier for you said the second soldier it is normal the first soldier said for you shut your dirty mouth said the first soldier i am simply a man who tells the truth it was a bright april day and the wind was blowing wildly so that each mule that came up the gap raised a cloud of dust and the two men at the ends of a stretcher each raised a cloud of dust that blew together and made one and below across the flat long streams of dust moved out from the ambulances and blew away in the wind i felt quite sure i was not going to be killed on that day now since we had done our work well in the morning and twice during the early part of the attack we should have been killed and were not and this had given me confidence the first time had been when we had gone up with the tanks and picked a place from which to film the attack later i had a sudden distrust for the place and we had moved the cameras about two hundred yards to the left just before leaving i had marked the place in quite the oldest way there is of marking a place and within ten minutes a six inch shell had lit on the exact place where i had been and there was no trace of any human being ever having been there instead there was a large and clearly blasted hole in the earth then two hours later a polish officer recently detached from the batalion and attached to the staff had offered to show us the positions the poles had just captured and coming from under the lee of a fold of hill we had walked into machine gun fire that we had to crawl out from under with our chins tight to the ground and dust in our noses and at the same time made the sad discovery that the poles had captured no positions at all that day but were a little further back than the place they had started from and now lying in the shelter of the trench i was wet with sweat hungry and thirsty and hollow inside from the now finished danger of the attack you are sure you are not russians asked a soldier there are russians here today yes but we are not russians you have the face of a russian no i said you are wrong comrade i have quite a funny face but it is not the face of a russian he has the face of a russian pointing at the other one of us who was working on a camera perhaps but still he is not russian where you from extremadura he said proudly are there any russians in extremadura i asked no he told me even more proudly there are no russians in extremadura and there are no extremadurans in russia what are your politics i hate all foreigners he said that s a broad political program i hate the moors the english the french the italians the germans the north americans and the russians you hate them in that order yes but perhaps i hate the russians the most man you have very interesting ideas i said are you a fascist no i am an extremaduran and i hate foreigners he has very rare ideas said another soldier do not give him too much importance me i like foreigners i am from valencia take another cup of wine please i reached up and took the cup the other wine still brassy in my mouth i looked at the extremaduran he was tall and thin his face was haggard and unshaven and his cheeks were sunken he stood straight up in his rage his blanket cape around his shoulders keep your head down i told him there are many lost bullets coming over i have no fear of bullets and i hate all foreigners he said fiercely you don t have to fear bullets i said but you should avoid them when you are in reserve it is not intelligent to be wounded when it can be avoided i am not afraid of anything the extremaduran said you are very lucky comrade it s true the other with the wine cup said he has no fear not even of the aviones he is crazy another soldier said everyone fears planes they kill little but make much fear i have no fear neither of planes nor of nothing the extremaduran said and i hate every foreigner alive down the gap walking beside two stretcher bearers and seeming to pay no attention at all to where he was came a tall man in international brigade uniform with a blanket rolled over his shoulder and tied at his waist his head was held high and he looked like a man walking in his sleep he was middle aged he was not carrying a rifle and from where i lay he did not look wounded i watched him walking alone down out of the war before he came to the staff cars he turned to the left and his head still held high in that strange way he walked over the edge of the ridge and out of sight the one who was with me busy changing film in the hand cameras had not noticed him a single shell came in over the ridge and fountained in the dirt and black smoke just short of the tank reserve someone put his head out of the cave where brigade headquarters was and then disappeared inside i thought it looked like a good place to go but knew they would all be furious in there because the attack was a failure and i did not want to face them if an operation was successful they were happy to have motion pictures of it but if it was a failure everyone was in such a rage there was always a chance of being sent back under arrest they may shell us now i said that makes no difference to me said the extremaduran i was beginning to be a little tired of the extremaduran have you any more wine to spare i asked my mouth was still dry yes man there are gallons of it the friendly soldier said he was short big fisted and very dirty with a stubble of beard about the same length as the hair on his cropped head do you think they will shell us now they should i said but in this war you can never tell what is the matter with this war asked the extremaduran angrily don t you like this war shut up said the friendly soldier i command here and these comrades are our guests then let him not talk against our war said the extremaduran no foreigners shall come here and talk against our war what town are you from comrade i asked the extremaduran badajoz he said i am from badajoz in badajoz we have been sacked and pillaged and our women violated by the english the french and now the moors what the moors have done now is no worse than what the english did under wellington you should read history my great grandmother was killed by the english the house where my family lived was burned by the english i regret it i said why do you hate the north americans my father was killed by the north americans in cuba while he was there as a conscript i am sorry for that too truly sorry believe me and why do you hate the russians because they are the representatives of tyranny and i hate their faces you have the face of a russian maybe we better get out of here i said to the one who was with me and who did not speak spanish it seems i have the face of a russian and it s getting me into trouble i m going to sleep he said this is a good place don t talk so much and you won t get into trouble there s a comrade here that doesn t like me i think he s an anarchist well watch out he doesn t shoot you then i m going to sleep just then two men in leather coats one short and stocky the other of medium height both with civilian caps flat high cheekboned faces wooden holstered mauser pistols strapped to their legs came out of the gap and headed toward us the taller of them spoke to me in french have you seen a french comrade pass through here he asked a comrade with a blanket tied around his shoulders in the form of a bandoleer a comrade of about forty five or fifty years old have you seen such a comrade going in the direction away from the front no i said i have not seen such a comrade he looked at me a moment and i noticed his eyes were a grayish yellow and that they did not blink at all thank you comrade he said in his odd french and then spoke rapidly to the other man with him in a language i did not understand they went off and climbed the highest part of the ridge from where they could see down all the gullies there is the true face of russians the extremaduran said shut up i said i was watching the two men in the leather coats they were standing there under considerable fire looking carefully over all the broken country below the ridge and toward the river suddenly one of them saw what he was looking for and pointed then the two started to run like hunting dogs one straight down over the ridge the other at an angle as though to cut someone off before the second one went over the crest i could see him drawing his pistol and holding it ahead of him as he ran and how do you like that asked the extremaduran no better than you i said over the crest of the parallel ridge i heard the mausers jerky barking they kept it up for more than a dozen shots they must have opened fire at too long a range after all the burst of shooting there was a pause and then a single shot the extremaduran looked at me sullenly and said nothing i thought it would be simpler if the shelling started but it did not start the two in the leather coats and civilian caps came back over the ridge walking together and then down to the gap walking downhill with that odd bent kneed way of the two legged animal coming down a steep slope they turned up the gap as a tank came whirring and clanking down and moved to one side to let it pass the tanks had failed again that day and the drivers coming down from the lines in their leather helmets the tank turrets open now as they came into the shelter of the ridge had the straight ahead stare of football players who have been removed from a game for yellowness the two flat faced men in the leather coats stood by us on the ridge to let the tank pass did you find the comrade you were looking for i asked the taller one of them in french yes comrade thank you he said and looked me over very carefully what does he say the extremaduran asked he says they found the comrade they were looking for i told him the extremaduran said nothing we had been all that morning in the place the middle aged frenchman had walked out of we had been there in the dust the smoke the noise the receiving of wounds the death the fear of death the bravery the cowardice the insanity and failure of an unsuccessful attack we had been there on that plowed field men could not cross and live you dropped and lay flat making a mound to shield your head working your chin into the dirt waiting for the order to go up that slope no man could go up and live we had been with those who lay there waiting for the tanks that did not come waiting under the inrushing shriek and roaring crash of the shelling the metal and the earth thrown like clods from a dirt fountain and overhead the cracking whispering fire like a curtain we knew how those felt waiting they were as far forward as they could get and men could not move further and live when the order came to move ahead we had been there all morning in the place the middle aged frenchman had come walking away from i understood how a man might suddenly seeing clearly the stupidity of dying in an unsuccessful attack or suddenly seeing it clearly as you can see clearly and justly before you die seeing its hopelessness seeing its idiocy seeing how it really was simply get back and walk away from it as the frenchman had done he could walk out of it not from cowardice but simply from seeing too clearly knowing suddenly that he had to leave it knowing there was no other thing to do the frenchman had come walking out of the attack with great dignity and i understood him as a man but as a soldier these other men who policed the battle had hunted him down and the death he had walked away from had found him when he was just over the ridge clear of the bullets and the shelling and walking toward the river and that the extremaduran said to me nodding toward the battle police is war i said in war it is necessary to have discipline and to live under that sort of discipline we should die without discipline everyone will die anyway there is one kind of discipline and another kind of discipline the extremaduran said listen to me in february we were here where we are now and the fascists attacked they drove us from the hills that you internationals tried to take today and that you could not take we fell back to here to this ridge internationals came up and took the line ahead of us i know that i said but you do not know this he went on angrily there was a boy from my province who became frightened during the bombardment and he shot himself in the hand so that he could leave the line because he was afraid the other soldiers were all listening now several nodded such people have their wounds dressed and are returned at once to the line the extremaduran went on it is just yes i said that is as it should be that is as it should be said the extremaduran but this boy shot himself so badly that the bone was all smashed and there surged up an infection and his hand was amputated several soldiers nodded go on tell him the rest said one it might be better not to speak of it said the cropped headed bristly faced man who said he was in command it is my duty to speak the extremaduran said the one in command shrugged his shoulders i did not like it either he said go on then but i do not like to hear it spoken of either this boy remained in the hospital in the valley since february the extremaduran said some of us have seen him in the hospital all say he was well liked in the hospital and made himself as useful as a man with one hand can be useful never was he under arrest never was there anything to prepare him the man in command handed me the cup of wine again without saying anything they were all listening as men who cannot read or write listen to a story yesterday at the close of day before we knew there was to be an attack yesterday before the sun set when we thought today was to be as any other day they brought him up the trail in the gap there from the flat we were cooking the evening meal and they brought him up there were only four of them him the boy paco those two you have just seen in the leather coats and the caps and an officer from the brigade we saw the four of them climbing together up the gap and we saw pace s hands were not tied nor was he bound in any way when we saw him we all crowded around and said hello paco how are you paco how is everything paco old boy old paco then he said everything s all right everything is good except this and showed us the stump paco said that was a cowardly and foolish thing i am sorry that i did that thing but i try to be useful with one hand i will do what i can with one hand for the cause yes interrupted a soldier he said that i heard him say that we spoke with him the extremaduran said and he spoke with us when such people with the leather coats and the pistols come it is always a bad omen in a war as is the arrival of people with map cases and field glasses still we thought they had brought him for a visit and all of us who had not been to the hospital were happy to see him and as i say it was the hour of the evening meal and the evening was clear and warm this wind only rose during the night a soldier said then the extremaduran went on somberly one of them said to the officer in spanish where is the place where is the place this paco was wounded asked the officer i answered him said the man in command i showed the place it is a little further down than where you are here is the place said a soldier he pointed and i could see it was the place it showed clearly that it was the place then one of them led paco by the arm to the place and held him there by the arm while the other spoke in spanish he spoke in spanish making many mistakes in the language at first we wanted to laugh and paco started to smile i could not understand all the speech but it was that paco must be punished as an example in order that there would be no more self inflicted wounds and that all others would be punished in the same way then while the one held paco by the arm paco looking very ashamed to be spoken of this way when he was already ashamed and sorry the other took his pistol out and shot paco in the back of the head without any word to paco nor any word more the soldiers all nodded it was thus said one you can see the place he fell with his mouth there you can see it i had seen the place clearly enough from where i lay he had no warning and no chance to prepare himself the one in command said it was very brutal it is for this that i now hate russians as well as all other foreigners said the extremaduran we can give ourselves no illusions about foreigners if you are a foreigner i am sorry but for myself now i can make no exceptions you have eaten bread and drunk wine with us now i think you should go do not speak in that way the man in command said to the extremaduran it is necessary to be formal i think we had better go i said you are not angry the man in command said you can stay in this shelter as long as you wish are you thirsty do you wish more wine thank you very much i said i think we had better go you understand my hatred asked the extremaduran i understand your hatred i said good he said and put out his hand i do not refuse to shake hands and that you personally have much luck equally to you i said personally and as a spaniard i woke the one who took the pictures and we started down the ridge toward brigade headquarters the tanks were all coming back now and you could hardly hear yourself talk for the noise were you talking all that time listening hear anything interesting plenty what do you want to do now get back to madrid we should see the general yes i said we must the general was coldly furious he had been ordered to make the attack as a surprise with one brigade only bringing everything up before daylight it should have been made by at least a division he had used three battalions and held one in reserve the french tank commander had got drunk to be brave for the attack and finally was too drunk to function he was to be shot when he sobered up the tanks had not come up in time and finally had refused to advance and two of the battalions had failed to attain their objectives the third had taken theirs but it formed an untenable salient the only real result had been a few prisoners and these had been confided to the tank men to bring back and the tank men had killed them the general had only failure to show and they had killed his prisoners what can i write on it i asked nothing that is not in the official communiqué have you any whisky in that long flask yes he took a drink and licked his lips carefully he had once been a captain of hungarian hussars and he had once captured a gold train in siberia when he was a leader of irregular cavalry with the red army and held it all one winter when the thermometer went down to forty below zero we were good friends and he loved whisky and he is now dead get out of here now he said have you transport yes did you get any pictures some the tanks the tanks he said bitterly the swine the cowards watch out you don t get killed he said you are supposed to be a writer i can t write now write it afterwards you can write it all afterwards and don t get killed especially don t get killed now get out of here he could not take his own advice because he was killed two months later but the oddest thing about that day was how marvelously the pictures we took of the tanks came out on the screen they advanced over the hill irresistibly mounting the crests like great ships to crawl clanking on toward the illusion of victory we screened the nearest any man was to victory that day was probably the frenchman who came with his head held high walking out of the battle but his victory only lasted until he had walked halfway down the ridge we saw him lying stretched out there on the slope of the ridge still wearing his blanket as we came walking down the cut to get into the staff car that would take us to madrid nobody ever dies the house was built of rose colored plaster that had peeled and faded with the dampness and from its porch you could see the sea very blue at the end of the street there were laurel trees along the sidewalk that grew high enough to shade the upper porch and in the shade it was cool a mockingbird hung in a wicker cage at a corner of the porch and it was not singing now nor even chirping because a young man of about twenty eight thin dark with bluish circles under his eyes and a stubble of beard had just taken off a sweater that he wore and spread it over the cage the young man was standing now his mouth slightly open listening someone was trying the locked and bolted front door as he listened he heard the wind in the laurels close beside the porch the horn of a taxi coming along the street and the voices of the children playing in a vacant lot then he heard a key turn again in the lock of the front door he heard it unlock the door heard the door pulled against the bolt and then the lock being turned again at the same time he heard the sound of a bat against a baseball and shrill shouting in spanish from the vacant lot he stood there moistening his lips and listened while someone tried the back door the young man who was named enrique took off his shoes and putting them down carefully moved softly along the tiling of the porch until he could look down at the back door there was no one there he slipped back to the front of the house and keeping out of sight looked down the street a negro in a narrow brimmed flat topped straw hat and a gray alpaca coat and black trousers was walking along the sidewalk under the laurel trees enrique watched but there was no one else he stood there for some time watching and listening then he took his sweater off the bird cage and put it on he had been sweating heavily while he had been listening and now he was cold in the shade and the cool northeast wind the sweater covered a leather shoulder holster the leather ringed and saltwhitened with perspiration that he wore with a forty five caliber colt pistol which by its constant pressure had given him a boil a little below his armpit he lay down on a canvas cot now close to the wall of the house he was still listening the bird chirped and hopped about the cage and the young man looked up at it then he got up and unhooked the door of the cage and opened it the bird cocked his head at the open door and drew it back then jerked his head forward again his bill pointing at an angle go on the young man said softly it s not a trick he put his hand into the cage and the bird flew against the back fluttering against the withes you re silly the young man said he took his hand out of the cage i ll leave it open he lay face down on the cot his chin on his folded arms and he was still listening he heard the bird fly out of the cage and then he heard him sing in one of the laurel trees it was foolish to keep the bird if the house is supposed to be empty he thought it is just such foolishness that makes all the trouble how can i blame others when i am that stupid in the vacant lot the boys were still playing baseball and it was quite cool now the young man unbuckled the leather shoulder holster and laid the big pistol by his leg then he went to sleep when he woke it was dark and the street light on the comer shone through the leaves of the laurels he stood up and walked to the front of the house and keeping in the shadow and the shelter of the wall looked up and down the street a man in a narrow brimmed flat topped straw hat stood under a tree on the comer enrique could not see the color of his coat or trousers but he was a negro enrique went quickly to the back of the porch but there was no light there except that which shone on the weedy field from the back windows of the next two houses there could be any number of people in the back he knew that since he could no longer really hear as he had in the afternoon because a radio was going in the second house away suddenly there came the mechanical crescendo of a siren and the young man felt a prickling wave go over his scalp it came as suddenly as a person blushes it felt like prickly heat and it was gone as quickly as it came the siren was on the radio it was part of an advertisement and the announcer s voice followed gavis tooth paste unaltering insuperable the best enrique smiled in the dark it was time someone should be coming now after the siren on the recorded announcements came a crying baby which the announcer said would be satisfied with malta malta and then there was a motor horn and a customer who demanded green gas don t tell me any stories i asked for green gas more economical more mileage the best enrique knew all the advertisements by heart they had not changed in the fifteen months that he had been away at war they must still be using the same discs in the broadcasting station and still the siren had deceived him and given him that thin quick prickle across the scalp that was as definite a reaction to danger as a bird dog stiffening to the warm scent of quail he had not had that prickle when he started danger and the fear of it had once made him feel empty in his stomach they had made him feel weak as you are weak with a fever and he had known the inability to move when you must force movement forward by legs that feel as dead as though they were asleep that was all gone now and he did without difficulty whatever he should do the prickling was all that remained of the vast capacity for fear some brave men start with it was his only remaining reaction to danger except for the perspiring which he knew he would always have and now it served as a warning and nothing more as he stood looking out at the tree where the man with the straw hat sat now on the curb a stone fell on the tiled floor of the porch enrique looked for it against the wall but did not find it he passed his hands under the cot but it was not there as he knelt another pebble fell on the tiled floor bounced and rolled into the corner toward the side of the house and into the street enrique picked it up it was a smooth feeling ordinary pebble and he put it in his pocket and went inside the house and down the stairs to the back door he stood to one side of the door and took the colt out of the holster and held it heavy in his right hand the victory he said very quietly in spanish his mouth disdaining the word and shifted softly on his bare feet to the other side of the door to those who earn it someone said outside the door it was a woman s voice giving the second half of the password and it spoke quickly and unsteadily enrique drew back the double bolt on the door and opened it with his left hand the colt still in his right there was a girl there in the dark holding a basket she wore a handkerchief over her head hello he said and shut the door and bolted it he could hear her breathing in the dark he took the basket from her and patted her shoulder enrique she said and he could not see the way her eyes were shining nor the look on her face come upstairs he said there is someone watching the front of the house did he see you no she said i came across the vacant lot i will show him to you come up to the porch they went up the stairs enrique carrying the basket he put it down by the bed and walked to the edge of the porch and looked the negro who wore the narrow brimmed flat topped straw hat was gone so enrique said quietly so what asked the girl holding his arm now and looking out so he is gone what is there to eat i am sorry you were here alone all day she said it was so stupid that i had to wait until it was dark to come i have wanted to come all day it was stupid to be here at all they brought me here from the boat before daylight and left me with a password and nothing to eat in a house that is watched you cannot eat a password i should not be put in a house that is being watched for other reasons it is very cuban but at least in the old days we ate how are you maria in the dark she kissed him hard on the mouth he felt the tight pressed fullness of her lips and the way her body shivered against his and then came the stab of white pain in the small of his back ayee be careful what is it the back what of the back is it a wound you should see it he said can i see it now afterwards we must eat and get out of here what have they stored here too many things things left over from the failure of april things kept for the future the long distant future he said did they know it was watched i am sure not what is there there are some rifles in cases there are boxes of ammunition everything should be moved tonight his mouth was full there will be years of work before we will need this again do you like the escabeche it s very good sit here close enrique she said sitting tight against him she put a hand on his thigh and with the other she stroked the back of his neck my enrique touch me carefully he said eating the back is bad are you happy to be back from the war i have not thought about it he said enrique how is chucho dead at lérida felipe dead also at lérida and arturo dead at teruel and vicente she asked in a flat voice her two hands folded on his thigh now dead at the attack across the road at celadas vicente is my brother she sat stiff and alone now her hands away from him i know said enrique he went on eating he is my only brother i thought you knew said enrique i did not know and he is my brother i am sorry maria i should have said it another way and he is dead you know he is dead it is not just a report listen rogello basilio esteban fel and i are alive the others are dead all all said enrique i cannot stand it said maria please i cannot stand it it does no good to discuss it they are dead but it is not only that vicente is my brother i can give up my brother it is the flower of our party yes the flower of the party it is not worth it it has destroyed the best yes it is worth it how can you say that that is criminal no it is worth it she was crying now and enrique went on eating don t cry he said the thing to do is to think how we can work to take their places but he is my brother don you uderstand my brother we are all brothers some are dead and others still live they send us home now so there will be some left otherwise there would be none now we must work but why were they all killed we were with an attack division you are either killed or wounded we others have been wounded how was vicente killed he was crossing the road when he was struck by machine gun fire from a farmhouse on the right the road was enfiladed from that house were you there yes i had the first company we were on his right we took the house but it took some time they had three machine guns there two in the house one in the stable it was difficult to approach we had to get a tank up to put fire on the window before we could rush the last gun i lost eight men it was too many and where was that celadas i never heard of it no said enrique the operation was not a success no one will ever hear of it that was where vicente and ignacio were killed and you say such things are justified that men like that should die in failures in a foreign country there are no foreign countries maria where people speak spanish where you die does not matter if you die for liberty anyway the thing to do is live and not to die but think of who have died away from here and in failures they did not go to die they went to fight the dying is an accident but the failures my brother is dead in a failure chucho in a failure ignacio in a failure they are just a part some things we had to do were impossible many that looked impossible we did but sometimes the people on your flank would not attack sometimes there was not enough artillery sometimes we were ordered to do things not in sufficient force as at celadas those make the failures but in the end it was not a failure she did not answer and he finished eating the wind was fresh now in the trees and it was cold on the porch he put the dishes back in the basket and wiped his mouth on the napkin he wiped his hands carefully and then put his arm around the girl she was crying don t cry maria he said what has happened has happened we must think of what there is to do there is much to do she said nothing and he could see her face in the light from the street lamp looking straight ahead we must check all romanticism this place is an example of that romanticism we must stop terrorism we must proceed so that we will never again fall into revolutionary adventurism the girl still said nothing and he looked at her face that he had thought of all the months when he had thought of anything except his work you talk like a book she said not like a human being i am sorry he said it is only lessons i have learned it is things i know must be done to me it is more real than anything all that is real to me are the dead she said we honor them but they are not important you talk like a book again she said angrily your heart is a book i am sorry maria i thought you would understand all i understand is the dead she said he knew this was not true because she had not seen them dead as he had in the rain in the olive groves of the jarama in the heat in the smashed houses of quijorna and in the snow at teruel but he knew that she blamed him for being alive when vicente was dead and suddenly in the small and unconditioned human part of him which was left and which he did not realize was still there he was hurt deeply there was a bird he said a mockingbird in a cage yes i let it go aren t you kind she said scornfully are soldiers all sentimental i am a good soldier i believe it you talk like one what kind of soldier was my brother very good gayer than me i was not gay it is a lack but you practice self criticism and you talk like a book it would be better if i were gayer he said i could never learn it and the gay ones are all dead no he said basilio is gay then he ll die she said maria do not talk like that you talk like a defeatist you talk like a book she told him please do not touch me you have a dry heart and i hate you now he was hurt again he who had thought that his heart was dry and that nothing could hurt ever again except the pain and sitting on the bed he leaned forward pull up my sweater he said i don t want to he pulled up the back and leaned over maria look there he said that is not from a book i cannot see she said i do not want to see put your hand across the lower back he felt her fingers touch that huge sunken place a baseball could have been pushed through that grotesque scar from the wound the surgeon had pushed his rubber gloved fist through in cleaning which had run from one side of the small of his back through to the other he felt her touch it and he shrank quickly inside then she was holding him tight and kissing him her lips an island in the sudden white sea of pain that came in a shining unbearable rising blinding wave and swept him clean the lips there still there then overwhelmed and the pain gone as he sat alone wet with sweat and maria crying and saying oh enrique forgive me please forgive me it is all right enrique said there is nothing to forgive but it was not out of any book but does it hurt always only when i am touched or jarred and the spinal cord it was touched a very little also the kidneys but they are all right the shell fragment went in one side and out the other there are other wounds lower down and on my legs enrique please forgive me there is nothing to forgive but it is not nice that i cannot make love and i am sorry that i am not gay we can make love after it is well yes and it will be well yes and i will take care of you no i will take care of you i do not mind this thing at all only the pain of touching or jarring it does not bother me now we must work we must leave this place now everything that is here must be moved tonight it must be stored in a new and unsuspected place and in one where it will not deteriorate it will be a long time before we will need it there is much to be done before we will ever reach that stage again many must be educated these cartridges may no longer serve by then this climate ruins the primers and we must go now i am a fool to have stayed here this long and the fool who put me here will answer to the committee i am to take you there tonight they thought this house was safe for you to stay today this house is a folly we will go now we should have gone before kiss me enrique we ll do it very carefully he said then in the dark on the bed holding himself carefully his eyes closed their lips against each other the happiness there with no pain the being home suddenly there with no pain the being alive returning and no pain the comfort of being loved and still no pain so there was a hollowness of loving now no longer hollow and the two sets of lips in the dark pressing so that they were happily and kindly darkly and warmly at home and without pain in the darkness there came the siren cutting suddenly to rise like all the pain in the world it was the real siren not the one of the radio it was not one siren it was two they were coming both ways up the street he turned his head and then stood up he thought that coming home had not lasted very long go out the door and across the lot he said go i can shoot from up here and make a diversion no you go she said please i will stay here to shoot and they will think you re inside come on he said we ll both go there s nothing to defend here this stuff is useless it s better to get away i want to stay she said i want to protect you she reached for the pistol in the holster under his arm and he slapped her face come on don t be a silly girl come on they were going down the stairs now and he felt her close beside him he swung the door open and together they stepped out the door and were clear of the building he turned and locked the door run maria he said across the lot in that direction go i want to go with you he slapped her again quickly run then dive in the weeds and crawl forgive me maria but go i go the other way go he said damn you go they started into the weeds at the same time he ran twenty paces and then as the police cars stopped in front of the house the sirens dying he dropped flat and started to crawl the weed pollen was dusty in his face and as he wriggled steadily along the sand burrs stabbing his hands and knees sharply and minutely he heard them coming around the house they had surrounded it he crawled steadily thinking hard giving no importance to the pain but why the sirens he thought why no third car from the rear why no spotlight or a searchlight on this field cubans he thought can they be this stupid and theatrical they must have thought there was no one in the house they must have come only to seize the stuff but why the sirens behind him he heard them breaking in the door they were all around the house he heard two blasts on a whistle from close to the house and he wriggled steadily on the fools he thought but they must have found the basket and the dishes by now what people what a way to raid a house he was almost to the edge of the lot now and he knew that he must rise and make a dash across the road for the far houses he had found a way of crawling that hurt little he could adjust himself to almost any movement it was the brusque changes that hurt and he dreaded rising to his feet in the weeds he rose on one knee took the shock of the pain held through it and then brought it on again as he drew the other foot alongside his knee in order to rise he started to run toward the house across the street at the back of the next lot when the clicking on of the searchlight caught him so that he was full in the beam looking toward it the blackness a sharp line on either side the searchlight was from the police car that had come silently without siren and posted itself at one back corner of the lot as enrique rose to his feet thin gaunt sharply outlined in the beam pulling at the big pistol in the holster under his armpit the submachine guns opened on him from the darkened car the feeling is that of being clubbed across the chest and he only felt the first one the other clubbing thuds that came were echoes he went forward onto his face in the weeds and as he fell or perhaps it was between the time the searchlight went on and the first bullet reached him he had one thought they are not so stupid perhaps something can be done with them if he had had time for another thought it would have been to hope there was no car at the other corner but there was a car at the other corner and its searchlight was going over the field its wide beam was playing over the weeds where the girl maria lay hidden in the dark car the machine gunners their guns poised followed the sweep of the beam with the fluted efficient ugliness of the thompson muzzles in the shadow of the tree behind the darkened car from which the searchlight played there was a negro standing he wore a flat topped narrow brimmed straw hat and an alpaca coat under his shirt he wore a string of blue voodoo beads he was standing quietly watching the lights working the searchlights played on over the weedfield where the girl lay flat against the ground her chin in the earth she had not moved since she heard the burst of firing she could feel her heart beating against the ground do you see her asked one of the men in the car let them beat through the weeds for the other side the lieutenant in the front seat said hola he called to the negro under the tree go to the house and tell them to beat toward us through the weeds in extended order are there only the two only two the negro said in a quiet voice we have the other one go yes sir lieutenant the negro said holding his straw hat in both hands he started to run along the edge of the field toward the house where now lights shone from all the windows in the field the girl lay her hands clasped across the top of her head help me to bear this she said into the weeds speaking to no one for there was no one there then suddenly personally sobbing help me vicente help me felipe help me chucho help me arturo help me now enrique help me at one time she would have prayed but she had lost that and now she needed something help me not to talk if they take me she said her mouth against the weeds keep me from talking enrique keep me from ever talking vicente behind her she could hear them going through the weeds like beaters in a rabbit drive they were spread wide and advancing like skirmishers flashing their electric torches in the weeds oh enrique she said help me she brought her hands down from her head and clenched them by her sides it is better so she thought if i run they will shoot it will be simpler slowly she got up and ran toward the car the searchlight was full on her and she ran seeing only it into its white blinding eye she thought this was the best way to do it behind her they were shouting but there was no shooting someone tackled her heavily and she went down she heard him breathing as he held her someone else took her under the arm and lifted her holding her by the two arms they walked her toward the car they were not rough with her but they walked her steadily toward the car no she said no no it s the sister of vicente irtube said the lieutenant she should be useful she s been questioned before said another never seriously no she said no no she cried aloud help me vicente help me help me enrique they re dead said someone they won t help you don t be silly yes she said they will help me it is the dead that will help me oh yes yes yes it is our dead that will help me take a look at enrique then said the lieutenant see if he will help you he s in the back of that car he s helping me now the girl maria said can t you see he s helping me now thank you enrique oh thank you come on said the lieutenant she s crazy leave four men to guard the stuff and we will send a truck for it we ll take this crazy up to headquarters she can talk up there no said maria taking hold of his sleeve can t you see everyone is helping me now no said the lieutenant you are crazy no one dies for nothing said maria everyone is helping me now get them to help you in about an hour said the lieutenant they will said maria please don t worry many many people are helping me now she sat there holding herself very still against the back of the seat she seemed now to have a strange confidence it was the same confidence another girl her age had felt a little more than five hundred years before in the market place of a town called rouen maria did not think of this nor did anyone in the car think of it the two girls named jeanne and maria had nothing in common except this sudden strange confidence which came when they needed it but all of the policemen in the car felt uncomfortable about maria now as she sat very straight with her face shining in the arc light the cars started and in the back seat of the front car men were putting the machine guns back into the heavy canvas cases slipping the stocks out and putting them in their diagonal pockets the barrels with the handgrips in the big flapped pouch the magazines in the narrow webbed pockets the negro with the flat straw hat came out from the shadow of the house and hailed the first car he got up into the front seat making two who rode there beside the driver and the four cars turned onto the main road that led toward the sea drive into la havana sitting crowded on the front seat of the car the negro reached under his shirt and put his fingers on the string of blue voodoo beads he sat without speaking his fingers holding the beads he had been a dock worker before he got a job as a stool pigeon for the havana police and he would get fifty dollars for this night s work fifty dollars is a lot of money now in la havana but the negro could no longer think about the money he turned his head a little very slowly as they came onto the lighted driveway of the malecon and looking back saw the girl s face shining proudly and her head held high the negro was frightened and he put his fingers all the way around the string of blue voodoo beads and held them tight but they could not help his fear because he was up against an older magic now the good lion once upon a time there was a lion that lived in africa with all the other lions the other lions were all bad lions and every day they ate zebras and wildebeests and every kind of antelope sometimes the bad lions ate people too they ate swahilis umbulus and wandorobos and they especially liked to eat hindu traders all hindu traders are very fat and delicious to a lion but this lion that we love because he was so good had wings on his back because he had wings on his back the other lions all made fun of him look at him with the wings on his back they would say and then they would all roar with laughter look at what he eats they would say because the good lion only ate pasta and scampi because he was so good the bad lions would roar with laughter and eat another hindu trader and their wives would drink his blood going lap lap lap with their tongues like big cats they only stopped to growl with laughter or to roar with laughter at the good lion and to snarl at his wings they were very bad and wicked lions indeed but the good lion would sit and fold his wings back and ask politely if he might have a negroni or an americano and he always drank that instead of the blood of the hindu traders one day he refused to eat eight masai cattle and only ate some tagliatelli and drank a glass of pomodoro this made the wicked lions very angry and one of the lionesses who was the wickedest of them all and could never get the blood of hindu traders off her whiskers even when she rubbed her face in the grass said who are you that you think you are so much better than we are where do you come from you pasta eating lion what are you doing here anyway she growled at him and they all roared without laughter my father lives in a city where he stands under the clock tower and looks down on a thousand pigeons all of whom are his subjects when they fly they make a noise like a rushing river there are more palaces in my father s city than in all of africa and there are four great bronze horses that face him and they all have one foot in the air because they fear him in my father s city men go on foot or in boats and no real horse would enter the city for fear of my father your father was a griffon the wicked lioness said licking her whiskers you are a liar one of the wicked lions said there is no such city pass me a piece of hindu trader another very wicked lion said this masai cattle is too newly killed you are a worthless liar and the son of a griffon the wickedest of all the lionesses said and now i think i shall kill you and eat you wings and all this frightened the good lion very much because he could see her yellow eyes and her tail going up and down and the blood caked on her whiskers and he smelled her breath which was very bad because she never brushed her teeth ever also she had old pieces of hindu trader under her claws don t kill me the good lion said my father is a noble lion and always has been respected and everything is true as i said just then the wicked lioness sprang at him but he rose into the air on his wings and circled the group of wicked lions once with them all roaring and looking at him he looked down and thought what savages these lions are he circled them once more to make them roar more loudly then he swooped low so he could look at the eyes of the wicked lioness who rose on her hind legs to try and catch him but she missed him with her claws adios he said for he spoke beautiful spanish being a lion of culture au revoir he called to them in his exemplary french they all roared and growled in african lion dialect then the good lion circled higher and higher and set his course for venice he alighted in the piazza and everyone was delighted to see him he flew up for a moment and kissed his father on both cheeks and saw the horses still had their feeet up and the basilica looked more beautiful than a soap bubble the campanile was in place and the pigeons were going to their nests for the evening how was africa his father said very savage father the good lion replied we have night lighting here now his father said so i see the good lion answered like a dutiful son it bothers my eyes a little his father confided to him where are you going now my son to harry s bar the good lion said remember me to cipriani and tell him i will be in some day soon to see about my bill said his father yes father said the good lion and he flew down lightly and walked to harry s bar on his own four paws in cipriani s nothing was changed all of his friends were there but he was a little changed himself from being in africa a negroni signor barone asked mr cipriani but the good lion had flown all the way from africa and africa had changed him do you have any hindu trader sandwiches he asked cipriani no but i can get some while you are sending for them make me a very dry martini he added with gordon s gin very good said cipriani very good indeed now the lion looked about him at the faces of all the nice people and he knew that he was at home but that he had also traveled he was very happy the faithful bull one time there was a bull and his name was not ferdinand and he cared nothing for flowers he loved to fight and he fought with all the other bulls of his own age or any age and he was a champion his horns were as solid as wood and they were as sharply pointed as the quill of a porcupine they hurt him at the base when he fought and he did not care at all his neck muscles lifted in a great lump that is called in spanish the morillo and this morillo lifted like a hill when he was ready to fight he was always ready to fight and his coat was black and shining and his eyes were clear anything made him want to fight and he would fight with deadly seriousness exactly as some people eat or read or go to church each time he fought he fought to kill and the other bulls were not afraid of him because they came of good blood and were not afraid but they had no wish to provoke him nor did they wish to fight him he was not a bully nor was he wicked but he liked to fight as men might like to sing or to be the king or the president he never thought at all fighting was his obligation and his duty and his joy he fought on the stony high ground he fought under the cork oak trees and he fought in the good pasture by the river he walked fifteen miles each day from the river to the high stony ground and he would fight any bull that looked at him still he was never angry that is not really true for he was angry inside himself but he did not know why because he could not think he was very noble and he loved to fight so what happened to him the man who owned him if anyone can own such an animal knew what a great bull he was and still he was worried because this bull cost him so much money by fighting with other bulls each bull was worth over one thousand dollars and after they had fought the great bull they were worth less than two hundred dollars and sometimes less than that so the man who was a good man decided that he would keep the blood of this bull in all of his stock rather than send him to the ring to be killed so he selected him for breeding but this bull was a strange bull when they first turned him into the pasture with the breeding cows he saw one who was young and beautiful and slimmer and better muscled and shinier and more lovely than all the others so since he could not fight he fell in love with her and he paid no attention to any of the others he only wanted to be with her and the others meant nothing to him at all the man who owned the bull ranch hoped that the bull would change or learn or be different than he was but the bull was the same and he loved whom he loved and no one else he only wanted to be with her and the others meant nothing to him at all so the man sent him away with five other bulls to be killed in the ring and at least the bull could fight even though he was faithful he fought wonderfully and everyone admired him and the man who killed him admired him the most but the fighting jacket of the man who killed him and who is called the matador was wet through by the end and his mouth was very dry que toro más bravo the matador said as he handed his sword to his sword handler he handed it with the hilt up and the blade dripping with the blood from the heart of the brave bull who no longer had any problems of any kind and was being dragged out of the ring by four horses yes he was the one the marqués of villamayor had to get rid of because he was faithful the sword handler who knew everything said perhaps we should all be faithful the matador said get a seeing eyed dog and what did we do then he asked her she told him that part is very strange i can t remember that at all can you remember the safari leaving i should but i don t i remember the women going down the trail to the beach for the water with the pots on their heads and i remember the flock of geese the toto drove back and forth to the water i remember how slowly they all went and they were always going down or coming up there was a very big tide too and the flats were yellow and the channel ran by the far island the wind blew all the time and there were no flies and no mosquitoes there was a roof and a cement floor and the poles that held the roof up and the wind blew through them all the time it was cool all day and lovely and cool at night do you remember when the big dhow came in and careened on the low tide yes i remember her and the crew coming ashore in her boats and coming up the path from the beach and the geese were afraid of them and so were the women that was the day we caught so many fish but had to come in because it was rough i remember that you re remembering well today she said don t do it too much i m sorry you didn t get to fly to zanzibar he said that upper beach from where we were was a fine place to land you could have landed and taken off from there quite easily we can always go to zanzibar don t try to remember too much today would you like me to read to you there s always something in the old new yorkers that we missed no please don t read he said just talk talk about the good days do you want to hear about what it s like outside it s raining he said i know that it s raining a big rain she told him there won t be any tourists out with this weather the wind is very wild and we can go down and sit by the fire we could anyway i don t care about them any more i like to hear them talk some of them are awful she said but some of them are quite nice i think it s really the nicest ones that go out to torcello that s quite true he said i hadn t thought of that there s really nothing for them to see unless they are a bit too nice can i make you a drink she asked you know how worthless a nurse i am i wasn t trained for it and i haven t any talent but i can make drinks let s have a drink what do you want anything he said i ll make a surprise i ll make it downstairs he heard the door open and close and her feet on the stairs and he thought i must get her to go on a trip i must figure out some way to do it i have to think up something practical i ve got this now for the rest of my life and i must figure out ways not to destroy her life and ruin her with it she has been so good and she was not built to be good i mean this sort of good i mean good every day and dull good he heard her coming up the stairs and noticed the difference in her tread when she was carrying two glasses and when she had walked down barehanded he heard the rain on the windowpane and he smelled the beech logs burning in the fireplace as she came into the room he put his hand out for the drink and closed his hand on it and felt her touch the glass with her own it s our old drink for out here she said campari and gordon s with ice i m certainly glad you re not a girl who would say on the rocks no she said i wouldn t ever say that we ve been on the rocks on our own two feet when the chips were down and for keeps he remembered do you remember when we barred those phrases that was in the time of my lion wasn t he a wonderful lion i can t wait till we see him i can t either he said i m sorry do you remember when we barred that phrase i nearly said it again you know he told her we re awfully lucky to have come here i remember it so well that it is palpable that s a new word and we ll bar it soon but it really is wonderful when i hear the rain i can see it on the stones and on the canal and on the lagoon and i know the way the trees bend in every wind and how the church and the tower are in every sort of light we couldn t have come to a better place for me it s really perfect we ve got the good radio and a fine tape recorder and i m going to write better than i ever could if you take your time with the tape recorder you can get the words right i can work slow and i can see the words when i say them if they re wrong i hear them wrong and i can do them over and work on them until i get them right honey in lots of ways we couldn t have it better oh philip shit he said the dark is just the dark this isn t like the real dark i can see very well inside and now my head is better all the time and i can remember and i can make up well you wait and see didn t i remember better today you remember better all the time and you re getting strong i am strong he said now if you if me what if you d go away for a while and get a rest and a change from this don t you want me of course i want you darling then why do we have to talk about me going away i know i m not good at looking after you but i can do things other people can t do and we do love each other you love me and you know it and we know things nobody else knows we do wonderful things in the dark he said and we did wonderful things in the daytime too you know i rather like the dark in some ways it is an improvement don t lie too much she said you don t have to be so bloody noble listen to it rain he said how is the tide now it s way out and the wind has driven the water even further out you could almost walk to burano all except one place he said are there many birds mostly gulls and terns they are down on the flats and when they get up the wind catches them aren t there any shore birds there are a few working on the part of the flats that only comes out when we have this wind and this tide do you think it will ever be spring i don t know she said it certainly doesn t act like it have you drunk all your drink just about why don t you drink yours i was saving it drink it up she said wasn t it awful when you couldn t drink at all no you see he said what i was thinking about when you went downstairs was that you could go to paris and then to london and you d see people and could have some fun and then you d come back and it would have to be spring by then and you could tell me all about everything no she said i think it would be intelligent to do he said you know this is a long sort of stupid business and we have to learn to pace ourselves and i don t want to wear you out you know i wish you wouldn t say you know so much you see that s one of the things i could learn to talk in a non irritating way you might be mad about me when you came back what would you do nights nights are easy i ll bet they are i suppose you ve learned how to sleep too i m going to he told her and drank half the drink that s part of the plan you know this is how it works if you go away and have some fun then i have a good conscience then for the first time in my life with a good conscience i sleep automatically i take a pillow which represents my good conscience and i put my arms around it and off i go to sleep if i wake up by any odd chance i just think beautiful happy dirty thoughts or i make wonderful fine good resolutions or i remember things you know i want you to have fun please don t say you know i ll concentrate on not saying it it s barred but i forget and let the bars down anyway i don t want you just to be a seeing eyed dog i m not and you know it anyway it s seeing eye not seeing eyed i knew that he told her come and sit here would you mind very much she came and sat by him on the bed and they both heard the rain hard against the pane of the window and he tried not to feel her head and her lovely face the way a blind man feels and there was no other way that he could touch her face except that way he held her close and kissed the top of her head i will have to try it another day he thought i must not be so stupid about it she feels so lovely and i love her so much and have done her so much damage and i must learn to take good care of her in every way i can if i think of her and of her only everything will be all right i won t say you know all the time any more he told her we can start with that she shook her head and he could feel her tremble you say it all you want she said and kissed him please don t cry my blessed he said i don t want you to sleep with any lousy pillow she said i won t not any lousy pillow stop it he said to himself stop it right now look tu he said we ll go down now and have lunch in our old fine place by the fire and i ll tell you what a wonderful kitten you are and what lucky kittens we are we really are we ll work everything out fine i just don t want to be sent away nobody is ever going to send you away but walking down the stairs feeling each stair carefully and holding to the banister he thought i must get her away and get her away as soon as i can without hurting her because i am not doing too well at this that i can promise you but what else can you do nothing he thought there s nothing you can do but maybe as you go along you will get good at it a man of the world the blind man knew the sounds of all the different machines in the saloon i don t know how long it took him to learn the sounds of the machines but it must have taken him quite a time because he only worked one saloon at a time he worked two towns though and he would start out of the flats along after it was good and dark on his way up to jessup he d stop by the side of the road when he heard a car coming and their lights would pick him up and either they would stop and give him a ride or they wouldn t and would go on by on the icy road it would depend on how they were loaded and whether there were women in the car because the blind man smelled plenty strong and especially in winter but someone would always stop for him because he was a blind man everybody knew him and they called him blindy which is a good name for a blind man in that part of the country and the name of the saloon that he threw his trade to was the pilot right next to it was another saloon also with gambling and a dining room that was called the index both of these were the names of mountains and they were both good saloons with old days bars and the gambling was about the same in one as in the other except you ate better in the pilot probably although you got a better sizzling steak at the index then the index was open all night long and got the early morning trade and from daylight until ten o clock in the morning the drinks were on the house they were the only saloons in jessup and they did not have to do that kind of thing but that was the way they were blindy probably preferred the pilot because the machines were right along the left hand wall as you came in and faced the bar this gave him better control over them than he would have had at the index where they were scattered on account it was a bigger place with more room on this night it was really cold outside and he came in with icicles on his mustache and small pus icicles out of both eyes and he didn t look really very good even his smell was froze but that wasn t for very long and he started to put out almost as soon as the door was shut it was always hard for me to look at him but i was looking at him carefully because i knew he always rode and i didn t see how he would be frozen up so bad finally i asked him where you walk from blindy willie sawyer put me out of his car down below the railway bridge there weren t no more cars come and i walked in what did he put you afoot for somebody asked said i smelled too bad someone had pulled the handle on a machine and blindy started listening to the whirr it came up nothing any dudes playing he asked me can t you hear not yet no dudes blindy and it s a wednesday i know what night it is don t start telling me what night it is blindy went down the line of machines feeling in all of them to see if anything had been left in the cups by mistake naturally there wasn t anything but that was the first part of his pitch he came back to the bar where we were and al chaney asked him to have a drink no blindy said i got to be careful on those roads what you mean those roads somebody asked him you only go on one road between here and the flats i been on lots of roads blindy said and any time i may have to take off and go on more somebody hit on a machine but it wasn t any heavy hit blindy moved on it just the same it was a quarter machine and the young fellow who was playing it gave him a quarter sort of reluctantly blindy felt it before he put it in his pocket thank you he said you ll never miss it the young fellow said nice to know that and put a quarter back in the machine and pulled down again he hit again but this time pretty good and he scooped in the quarters and gave a quarter to blindy thanks blindy said you re doing fine tonight s my night the young fellow who was playing said your night is my night blindy said and the young fellow went on playing but he wasn t doing any good any more and blindy was so strong standing by him and he looked so awful and finally the fellow quit playing and came over to the bar blindy had run him out but he had no way of noticing it because the fellow didn t say anything so blindy just checked the machines again with his hand and stood there waiting for someone else to come in and make a play there wasn t any play at the wheel nor at the crap table and at the poker game there were just gamblers sitting there and cutting each other up it was a quiet evening on a week night in town and there wasn t any excitement the place was not making a nickel except at the bar but at the bar it was pleasant and the place had been nice until blindy had come in now everybody was figuring they might as well go next door to the index or else cut out and go home what will yours be tom frank the bartender asked me this is on the house i was figuring on shoving have one first then the same with ditch i said frank asked the young fellow who was wearing heavy oregon cities and a black hat and was shaved clean and had a snow burned face what he would drink and the young fellow took the same the whisky was old forester i nodded to him and raised my drink and we both sipped at the drinks blindy was down at the far end of the machines i think he figured maybe no one would come in if they saw him at the door not that he was self conscious how did that man lose his sight the young fellow asked me in a fight frank told him i wouldn t know i told him him fight the stranger said he shook his head yeah frank said he got that high voice out of the same fight tell him tom i never heard of it no you wouldn t of frank said of course not you wasn t here i suppose mister it was a night about as cold as tonight maybe colder it was a quick fight too i didn t see the start of it then they come fighting out of the door of the index blackie him that s blindy now and this other boy willie sawyer and they were slugging and kneeing and gouging and biting and i see one of blackie s eyes hanging down on his cheek they were fighting on the ice of the road with the snow all banked up and the light from this door and the index door and hollis sands was right behind willie sawyer who was gouging for the eye and hollis kept hollering bite it off bite it off just like it was a grape blackie was biting onto willie sawyer s face and he had a good holt and it give way with a jerk and then he had another good holt and they were down on the ice now and willie sawyer was gouging him to make him let go and then blackie gave a yell like you ve never heard worse than when they cut a boar blindy had come up opposite us and we smelled him and turned around bite it off just like it was a grape he said in his high pitched voice and looked at us moving his head up and down that was the left eye he got the other one without no advice then he stomped me when i couldn t see that was the bad part he patted himself i could fight good then he said but he got the eye before i knew even what was happening he got it with a lucky gouge well blindy said without any rancor that put a stop to my fighting days give blackie a drink i said to frank blindy s the name tom i earned that name you seen me earn it that s the same fellow who put me adrift down the road tonight fellow bit the eye we ain t never made friends what did you do to him the stranger asked oh you ll see him around blindy said you ll recognize him any time you see him i ll let it come as a surprise you don t want to see him i told the stranger you know that s one of the reasons i d like to see sometimes blindy said i d like to just have one good look at him you know what he looks like frank told him you went up and put your hands on his face once did it again tonight too blindy said happily that s why he put me out of the car he ain t got no sense of humor at all i told him on a cold night like this he d ought to bundle up so the whole inside of his face wouldn t catch cold he didn t even think that was funny you know that willie sawyer he ll never be a man of the world blackie you have one on the house frank said i can t drive you home because i only live just down the road but you can sleep in the back of the place that s mighty good of you frank only just don t call me blackie i m not blackie any more blindy s my name have a drink blindy yes sir blindy said his hand reached out and found the glass and he raised it accurately to the three of us that willis sawyer he said probably alone home by himself that willie sawyer he don t know how to have any fun at all summer people halfway down the gravel road from hortons bay the town to the lake there was a spring the water came up in a tile sunk beside the road lipping over the cracked edge of the tile and flowing away through the close growing mint into the swamp in the dark nick put his arm down into the spring but could not hold it there because of the cold he felt the featherings of the sand spouting up from the spring cones at the bottom against his fingers nick thought i wish i could put all of myself in there i bet that would fix me he pulled his arm out and sat down at the edge of the road it was a hot night down the road through the trees he could see the white of the bean house on its piles over the water he did not want to go down to the dock everybody was down there swimming he did not want kate with odgar around he could see the car on the road beside the warehouse odgar and kate were down there odgar with that fried fish look in his eye every time he looked at kate didn t odgar know anything kate wouldn t ever marry him she wouldn t ever marry anybody that didn t make her and if they tried to make her she would curl up inside of herself and be hard and slip away he could make her do it all right instead of curling up hard and slipping away she would open out smoothly relaxing untightening easy to hold odgar thought it was love that did it his eyes got walleyed and red at the edges of the lids she couldn t bear to have him touch her it was all in his eyes then odgar would want them to be just the same friends as ever play in the sand make mud images take all day trips in the boat together kate always in her bathing suit odgar looking at her odgar was thirty two and had been twice operated on for varicocele he was ugly to look at and everybody liked his face odgar could never get it and it meant everything in the world to him every summer he was worse about it it was pitiful odgar was awfully nice he had been nicer to nick than anybody ever had now nick could get it if he wanted it odgar would kill himself nick thought if he knew it i wonder how he d kill himself he couldn t think of odgar dead he probably wouldn t do it still people did it wasn t just love odgar thought just love would do it odgar loved her enough god knows it was liking and liking the body and introducing the body and persuading and taking chances and never frightening and assuming about the other person and always taking never asking and gentleness and liking and making liking and happiness and joking and making people not afraid and making it all right afterwards it wasn t loving loving was frightening he nicholas adams could have what he wanted because of something in him maybe it did not last maybe he would lose it he wished he could give it to odgar or tell odgar about it you couldn t ever tell anybody about anything especially odgar no not especially odgar anybody anywhere that had always been his first mistake talking he had talked himself out of too many things there ought to be something you could do for the princeton yale and harvard virgins though why weren t there any virgins in state universities coeducation maybe they met girls who were out to marry and the girls helped them along and married them what would become of fellows like odgar and harvey and mike and all the rest he didn t know he hadn t lived long enough they were the best people in the world what became of them how the hell could he know how could he write like hardy and hamsun when he only knew ten years of life he couldn t wait till he was fifty in the dark he kneeled down and took a drink from the spring he felt all right he knew he was going to be a great writer he knew things and they couldn t touch him nobody could only he did not know enough things that would come all right he knew the water was cold and made his eyes ache he had swallowed too big a gulp like ice cream that s the way with drinking with your nose underwater he d better go swimming thinking was no good it started and went on so he walked down the road past the car and the big warehouse on the left where apples and potatoes were loaded onto the boats in the fall past the white painted bean house where they danced by lantern light sometimes on the hardwood floor out on the dock to where they were swimming they were all swimming off the end of the dock as nick walked along the rough boards high above the water he heard the double protest of the long springboard and a splash the water lapped below in the piles that must be the ghee he thought kate came up out of the water like a seal and pulled herself up the ladder it s wemedge she shouted to the others come on in wemedge it s wonderful hi wemedge said odgar boy it s great where s wemedge it was the ghee swimming far out is this man wemedge a nonswimmer bill s voice very deep and bass over the water nick felt good it was fun to have people yell at you like that he scuffed off his canvas shoes pulled his shirt over his head and stepped out of his trousers his bare feet felt the sandy planks of the dock he ran very quickly out the yielding plank of the springboard his toes shoved against the end of the board he tightened and he was in the water smoothly and deeply with no consciousness of the dive he had breathed in deeply as he took off and now went on and on through the water holding his back arched feet straight and trailing then he was on the surface floating face down he rolled over and opened his eyes he did not care anything about swimming only to dive and be underwater how is it wemedge the ghee was just behind him warm as piss nick said he took a deep breath took hold of his ankles with his hands his knees under his chin and sank slowly down into the water it was warm at the top but he dropped quickly into cool then cold as he neared the bottom it was quite cold nick floated down gently against the bottom it was marly and his toes hated it as he uncurled and shoved hard against it to come up to the air it was strange coming up from underwater into the dark nick rested in the water barely paddling and comfortable odgar and kate were talking together up on the dock have you ever swum in a sea where it was phosphorescent carl no odgar s voice was unnatural talking to kate we might rub ourselves all over with matches nick thought he took a deep breath drew his knees up clasped tight and sank this time with his eyes open he sank gently first going off to one side then sinking head first it was no good he could not see underwater in the dark he was right to keep his eyes shut when he first dove in it was funny about reactions like that they weren t always right though he did not go all the way down but straightened out and swam along and up through the cool keeping just below the warm surface water it was funny how much fun it was to swim underwater and how little fun there was in plain swimming it was fun to swim on the surface in the ocean that was the buoyancy but there was the taste of the brine and the way it made you thirsty fresh water was better just like this on a hot night he came up for air just under the projecting edge of the dock and climbed up the ladder oh dive wemedge will you kate said do a good dive they were sitting together on the dock leaning back against one of the big piles do a noiseless one wemedge odgar said all right nick dripping walked out on the springboard remembering how to do the dive odgar and kate watched him black in the dark standing at the end of the board poise and dive as he had learned from watching a sea otter in the water as he turned to come up to the air nick thought gosh if i could only have kate down here he came up in a rush to the surface feeling water in his eyes and ears he must have started to take a breath it was perfect absolutely perfect kate shouted from the dock nick came up the ladder where are the men he asked they re swimming way out in the bay odgar said nick lay down on the dock beside kate and odgar he could hear the ghee and bill swimming way out in the dark you re the most wonderful diver wemedge kate said touching his back with her foot nick tightened under the contact no he said you re a wonder wemedge odgar said nope nick said he was thinking thinking if it was possible to be with somebody underwater he could hold his breath three minutes against the sand on the bottom they could float up together take a breath and go down it was easy to sink if you knew how he had once drunk a bottle of milk and peeled and eaten a banana underwater to show off had to have weights though to hold him down if there was a ring at the bottom something he could get his arm through he could do it all right gee how it would be you couldn t ever get a girl though a girl couldn t go through with it she d swallow water it would drown kate kate wasn t really any good underwater he wished there was a girl like that maybe he d get a girl like that probably never there wasn t anybody but him that was that way underwater swimmers hell swimmers were slobs nobody knew about the water but him there was a fellow up at evanston that could hold his breath six minutes but he was crazy he wished he was a fish no he didn t he laughed what s the joke wemedge odgar said in his husky near to kate voice i wished i was a fish nick said that s a good joke said odgar sure said nick don t be an ass wemedge said kate would you like to be a fish butstein he said lying with his head on the planks facing away from them no said kate not tonight nick pressed his back hard against her foot what animal would you like to be odgar nick said j p morgan odgar said you re nice odgar kate said nick felt odgar glow i d like to be wemedge kate said you could always be mrs wemedge odgar said there isn t going to be any mrs wemedge nick said he tightened his back muscles kate had both her legs stretched out against his back as though she were resting them on a log in front of a fire don t be too sure odgar said i m awful sure nick said i m going to marry a mermaid she d be mrs wemedge kate said no she wouldn t nick said i wouldn t let her how would you stop her i d stop her all right just let her try it mermaids don t marry kate said that d be all right with me nick said the mann act would get you said odgar we d stay outside the four mile limit nick said we d get food from the rumrunners you could get a diving suit and come and visit us odgar bring butstein if she wants to come we ll be at home every thursday afternoon what are we going to do tomorrow odgar said his voice becoming husky near to kate again oh hell let s not talk about tomorrow nick said let s talk about my mermaid we re through with your mermaid all right nick said you and odgar go and talk i m going to think about her you re immoral wemedge you re disgustingly immoral no i m not i m honest then lying with his eyes shut he said don t bother me i m thinking about her he lay there thinking of his mermaid while kate s insteps pressed against his back and she and odgar talked odgar and kate talked but he did not hear them he lay no longer thinking quite happy bill and the ghee had come out of the water farther down the shore walked down the beach up to the car and then backed it out onto the dock nick stood up and put on his clothes bill and the ghee were in the front seat tired from the long swim nick got in behind with kate and odgar they leaned back bill drove roaring up the hill and turned onto the main road on the main highway nick could see the lights of other cars up ahead going out of sight then blinding as they mounted a hill blinking as they came near then dimmed as bill passed the road was high along the shore of the lake big cars out from charlevoix rich slobs riding behind their chauffeurs came up and passed hogging the road and not dimming their lights they passed like railway trains bill flashed the spotlights on cars alongside the road in the trees making the occupants change their positions nobody passed bill from behind although a spotlight played on the back of their heads for some time until bill drew away bill slowed then turned abruptly onto the sandy road that ran up through the orchard to the farmhouse the car in low gear moved steadily up through the orchard kate put her lips to nick s ear in about an hour wemedge she said nick pressed his thigh hard against hers the car circled at the top of the hill above the orchard and stopped in front of the house aunty s asleep we ve got to be quiet kate said good night men bill whispered we ll stop by in the morning good night smith whispered the ghee good night butstein good night ghee kate said odgar was staying at the house good night men nick said see you morgen night wemedge odgar said from the porch nick and the ghee walked down the road into the orchard nick reached up and took an apple from one of the duchess trees it was still green but he sucked the acid juice from the bite and spat out the pulp you and the bird took a long swim ghee he said not so long wemedge the ghee answered they came out from the orchard past the mailbox onto the hard state highway there was a cold mist in the hollow where the road crossed the creek nick stopped on the bridge come on wemedge the ghee said all right nick agreed they went on up the hill to where the road turned into the grove of trees around the church there were no lights in any of the houses they passed hortons bay was asleep no motor cars had passed them i don t feel like turning in yet nick said want me to walk with you no ghee don t bother all right i ll walk up as far as the cottage with you nick said they unhooked the screen door and went into the kitchen nick opened the meat safe and looked around want some of this ghee he said i want a piece of pie the ghee said so do i nick said he wrapped up some fried chicken and two pieces of cherry pie in oiled paper from the top of the icebox i ll take this with me he said the ghee washed down his pie with a dipper full of water from the bucket if you want anything to read ghee get it out of my room nick said the ghee had been looking at the lunch nick had wrapped up don t be a damn fool wemedge he said that s all right ghee all right only don t be a damn fool the ghee said he opened the screen door and went out across the grass to the cottage nick turned off the light and went out hooking the screen door shut he had the lunch wrapped up in a newspaper and crossed the wet grass climbed the fence and went up the road through the town under the big elm trees past the last cluster of r f d mailboxes at the crossroads and out onto the charlevoix highway after crossing the creek he cut across a field skirted the edge of the orchard keeping to the edge of the clearing and climbed the rail fence into the wood lot in the center of the wood lot four hemlock trees grew close together the ground was soft with pine needles and there was no dew the wood lot had never been cut over and the forest floor was dry and warm without underbrush nick put the package of lunch by the base of one of the hemlocks and lay down to wait he saw kate coming through the trees in the dark but did not move she did not see him and stood a moment holding the two blankets in her arms in the dark it looked like some enormous pregnancy nick was shocked then it was funny hello butstein he said she dropped the blankets oh wemedge you shouldn t have frightened me like that i was afraid you hadn t come dear butstein nick said he held her close against him feeling her body against his all the sweet body against his body she pressed close against him i love you so wemedge dear dear old butstein nick said they spread the blankets kate smoothing them flat it was awfully dangerous to bring the blankets kate said i know nick said let s undress oh wemedge it s more fun they undressed sitting on the blankets nick was a little embarrassed to sit there like that do you like me with my clothes off wemedge gee let s get under nick said they lay between the rough blankets he was hot against her cool body hunting for it then it was all right is it all right kate pressed all the way up for answer is it fun oh wemedge i ve wanted it so i ve needed it so they lay together in the blankets wemedge slid his head down his nose touching along the line of the neck down between her breasts it was like piano keys you smell so cool he said he touched one of her small breasts with his lips gently it came alive between his lips his tongue pressing against it he felt the whole feeling coming back again and sliding his hands down moved kate over he slid down and she fitted close in against him she pressed tight in against the curve of his abdomen she felt wonderful there he searched a little awkwardly then found it he put both hands over her breasts and held her to him nick kissed hard against her back kate s head dropped forward is it good this way he said i love it i love it i love it oh come wemedge please come come come please wemedge please please wemedge there it is nick said he was suddenly conscious of the blanket rough against his bare body was i bad wemedge kate said no you were good nick said his mind was working very hard and clear he saw everything very sharp and clear i m hungry he said i wish we could sleep here all night kate cuddled against him it would be swell nick said but we can t you ve got to get back to the house i don t want to go kate said nick stood up a little wind blowing on his body he pulled on his shirt and was glad to have it on he put on his trousers and shoes you ve got to get dressed stut he said she lay there the blankets pulled over her head just a minute she said nick got the lunch from over the hemlock he opened it up come on get dressed stut he said i don t want to kate said i m going to sleep here all night she sat up in the blankets hand me those things wemedge nick gave her the clothes i ve just thought of it kate said if i sleep out here they ll just think that i m an idiot and came out here with the blankets and it will be all right you won t be comfortable nick said if i m uncomfortable i ll go in let s eat before i have to go nick said i ll put something on kate said they sat together and ate the fried chicken and each ate a piece of cherry pie nick stood up then kneeled down and kissed kate he came through the wet grass to the cottage and upstairs to his room walking carefully not to creak it was good to be in bed sheets stretching out full length dipping his head in the pillow good in bed comfortable happy fishing tomorrow he prayed as he always prayed when he remembered it for the family himself to be a great writer kate the men odgar for good fishing poor old odgar poor old odgar sleeping up there at the cottage maybe not fishing maybe not sleeping all night still there wasn t anything you could do not a thing o r i g i n a l ly p u b l i s h e d i n t he n i c k a d a ms s t o r i e s t h i s s h o r t s t o ry w a s l eft u n c o mp l e t e d by he m i n gw ay the last good country nickie his sister said to him listen to me nickie i don t want to hear it he was watching the bottom of the spring where the sand rose in small spurts with the bubbling water there was a tin cup on a forked stick that was stuck in the gravel by the spring and nick adams looked at it and at the water rising and then flowing clear in its gravel bed beside the road he could see both ways on the road and he looked up the hill and then down to the dock and the lake the wooded point across the bay and the open lake beyond where there were white caps running his back was against a big cedar tree and behind him there was a thick cedar swamp his sister was sitting on the moss beside him and she had her arm around his shoulders the re waiting for you to come home to supper his sister said there s two of them they came in a buggy and they asked where you were did anybody tell them nobody knew where you were but me did you get many nickie i got twenty six are they good ones just the size they want for the dinners oh nickie i wish you wouldn t sell them she gives me a dollar a pound nick adams said his sister was tanned brown and she had dark brown eyes and dark brown hair with yellow streaks in it from the sun she and nick loved each other and they did not love the others they always thought of everyone else in the family as the others they know about everything nickie his sister said hopelessly they said they were going to make an example of you and send you to the reform school they ve only got proof on one thing nick told her but i guess i have to go away for a while can i go no i m sorry littless how much money have we got fourteen dollars and sixty five cents i brought it did they say anything else no only that they were going to stay till you came home our mother will get tired of feeding them she gave them lunch already what were they doing just sitting around on the screen porch they asked our mother for your rifle but i d hid it in the woodshed when i saw them by the fence were you expecting them yes weren t you i guess so goddam them goddam them for me too his sister said aren t i old

please take me she kissed him and held onto him with both her arms nick adams looked at her and tried to think straight it was difficult but there was no choice i shouldn t take you but then i shouldn t have done any of it he said i ll take you maybe only for a couple of days though that s all right she told him when you don t want me i ll go straight home i ll go home anyway if i m a bother or a nuisance or an expense let s think it out nick adams told her he looked up and down the road and up at the sky where the big high afternoon clouds were riding and at the white caps on the lake out beyond the point i d go through the woods down to the inn beyond the point and sell her the trout he told his sister she ordered them for dinners tonight right now they want more trout dinners than chicken dinners i don t know why the trout are in good shape i gutted them and they re wrapped in cheesecloth and they ll be cool and fresh i ll tell her i m in some trouble with the game wardens and that they re looking for me and i have to get out of the country for a while i ll get her to give me a small skillet and some salt and pepper and some bacon and some shortening and some com meal i ll get her to give me a sack to put everything in and i ll get some dried apricots and some prunes and some tea and plenty of matches and a hatchet but i can only get one blanket she ll help me because buying trout is just as bad as selling them i can get a blanket his sister said i ll wrap it around the rifle and i ll bring your moccasins and my moccasins and i ll change to different overalls and a shirt and hide these so they ll think i m wearing them and i ll bring soap and a comb and a pair of scissors and something to sew with and lorna doone and swiss family robinson bring all the 22 s you can find nick adams said then quickly come on back get out of sight he had seen a buggy coming down the road behind the cedars they lay flat against the springy moss with their faces down and heard the soft noise of the horses hooves in the sand and the small noise of the wheels neither of the men in the buggy was talking but nick adams smelled them as they went past and he smelled the sweated horses he sweated himself until they were well past on their way to the dock because he thought they might stop to water at the spring or to get a drink is that them littless he asked yeah she said crawl way back in nick adams said he crawled back into the swamp pulling his sack of fish the swamp was mossy and not muddy there then he stood up and hid the sack behind the trunk of a cedar and motioned the girl to come further in they went into the cedar swamp moving as softly as deer i know the one nick adams said he s a no good son of a bitch he said he d been after you for four years i know the other one the big one with the spit tobacco face and the blue suit is the one from down state good nick said now we ve had a look at them i better get going can you get home all right sure i ll cut up to the top of the hill and keep off the road where will i meet you tonight nickie i don t think you ought to come littless i ve got to come you don t know how it is i can leave a note for our mother and say i went with you and you ll take good care of me all right nick adams said i ll be where the big hemlock is that was struck by lightning the one that s down straight up from the cove do you know the one on the short cut to the road that s awfully close to the house i don t want you to have to carry the stuff too far i ll do what you say but don t take chances nickie i d like to have the rifle and go down now to the edge of the timber and kill both of those bastards while they re on the dock and wire a piece of iron on them from the old mill and sink them in the channel and then what would you do his sister asked somebody sent them nobody sent that first son of a bitch but you killed the moose and you sold the trout and you killed what they took from your boat that was all right to kill that he did not like to mention what that was because that was the proof they had i know but you re not going to kill people and that s why i m going with you let s stop talking about it but i d like to kill those two sons of bitches i know she said so would i but we re not going to kill people nickie will you promise me no now i don t know whether it s safe to take her the trout i ll take them to her no they re too heavy i ll take them through the swamp and to the woods in back of the hotel you go straight to the hotel and see if she s there and if everything s all right and if it is you ll find me there by the big basswood tree it s a long way there through the swamp nicky it s a long way back from reform school too can t i come with you through the swamp i ll go in then and see her while you stay out and come back out with you and take them in all right nick said but i wish you d do it the other way why nickie because you ll see them maybe on the road and you can tell me where they ve gone i ll see you in the second growth wood lot in back of the hotel where the big basswood is nick waited more than an hour in the second growth timber and his sister had not come when she came she was excited and he knew she was tired they re at our house she said they re sitting out on the screen porch and drinking whiskey and ginger ale and they ve unhitched and put their horses up they say they re going to wait till you come back it was our mother told them you d gone fishing at the creek i don t think she meant to anyway i hope not what about mrs packard i saw her in the kitchen of the hotel and she asked me if i d seen you and i said no she said she was waiting for you to bring her some fish for tonight she was worried you might as well take them in good he said they re nice and fresh i repacked them in ferns can i come in with you sure nick said the hotel was a long wooden building with a porch that fronted on the lake there were wide wooden steps that led down to the pier that ran far out into the water and there were natural cedar railings alongside the steps and natural cedar railings around the porch there were chairs made of natural cedar on the porch and in them sat middle aged people wearing white clothes there were three pipes set on the lawn with spring water bubbling out of them and little paths led to them the water tasted like rotten eggs because these were mineral springs and nick and his sister used to drink from them as a matter of discipline now coming toward the rear of the hotel where the kitchen was they crossed a plank bridge over a small brook running into the lake beside the hotel and slipped into the back door of the kitchen wash them and put them in the ice box nickie mrs packard said i ll weigh them later mrs packard nick said could i speak to you a minute speak up she said can t you see i m busy if i could have the money now mrs packard was a handsome woman in a gingham apron she had a beautiful complexion and she was very busy and her kitchen help were there as well you don t mean you want to sell trout don t you know that s against the law i know nick said i brought you the fish for a present i mean my time for the wood i split and corded i ll get it she said i have to go to the annex nick and his sister followed her outside on the board sidewalk that led to the icehouse from the kitchen she stopped and put her hands in her apron pocket and took out a pocketbook you get out of here she said quickly and kindly and get out of here fast how much do you need i ve got sixteen dollars nick said take twenty she told him and keep that tyke out of trouble let her go home and keep an eye on them until you re clear when did you hear about them she shook her head at him buying is as bad or worse than selling she said you stay away until things quiet down nickie you re a good boy no matter what anybody says you see packard if things get bad come here nights if you need anything i sleep light just knock on the window you aren t going to serve them tonight are you mrs packard you re not going to serve them for the dinners no she said but i m not going to waste them packard can

big hemlocks on the hill behind the house now it was evening and the sun was down beyond the hills on the other side of the lake i ve found everything his sister said it s going to make a pretty big pack nickie i know it what are they doing they ate a big supper and now they re sitting out on the porch and drinking they re telling each other stories about how smart they are they aren t very smart so far they re going to starve you out his sister said a couple of nights in the woods and you ll be back you hear a loon holler a couple of times when you got an empty stomach and you ll be back what did our mother give them for supper awful his sister said good i ve located everything on the list our mother s gone to bed with a sick headache she wrote our father did you see the letter no it s in

medicine cabinet no i could put paregoric in the bottle they have another bottle or calomel i know we ve got those no said nick you try to get me about half the other bottle when they re asleep put it in any old medicine bottle i better go and watch them his sister said my i wish we had knockout drops i never even heard of them they aren t really drops nick told her it s chloral hydrate whores give it to lumberjacks in their drinks when they re going to jack roll them it sounds pretty bad his sister said but we probably ought to have some for in emergencies let me kiss you her brother said just for in an emergency let s go down and watch them drinking i d like to hear them talk sitting in our own house will you promise not to get angry and do anything bad sure nor to the horses it s not the horses fault not the horses either i wish we had knockout drops his sister said loyally well we haven t nick told her i guess there aren t any this side of boyne city they sat in the woodshed and they watched the two men sitting at the table on the screen porch the moon had not risen and it was dark but the outlines of the men showed against the lightness that the lake made behind them they were not talking now but were both leaning forward on the table then nick heard the clink of ice against a bucket the ginger ale s gone one of the men said i said it wouldn t last the other said but you were the one said we had plenty get some water there s a pail and a dipper in the kitchen i ve drunk enough i m going to turn in aren t you going to stay up for that kid no i m going to get some sleep you stay up do you think he ll come in tonight i don t know i m going to get some sleep you wake me when you get sleepy i can stay up all night the local warden said many s the night i ve stayed up all night for jack lighters and never shut an eye me too the down state man said but now i m going to get a little sleep nick and his sister watched him go in the door their mother had told the two men they could sleep in the bedroom next to the living room they saw when he struck a match then the window was dark again they watched the other warden sitting at the table until he put his head on his arms then they heard him snoring we ll give him a little while to make sure he s solid asleep then we ll get the stuff nick said you get over outside the fence his sister said it doesn t matter if i m moving around but he might wake up and see you all right nick agreed i ll get everything out of here most of it s here can you find everything without a light sure where s the rifle flat on the back upper rafter don t slip or make the wood fall down nick don t you worry she came out to the fence at the far corner where nick was making up his pack beyond the big hemlock that had been struck by lightning the summer before and had fallen in a storm that autumn the moon was just rising now behind the far hills and enough moonlight came through the trees for nick to see clearly what he was packing his sister put down the sack she was carrying and said they re sleeping like pigs nickie good the down state one was snoring just like the one outside i think i got everything you good old littless i wrote a note to our mother and told her i was going with you to keep you out of trouble and not to tell anybody and that you d take good care of me i put it under her door it s locked oh shit nick said then he said i m sorry littless now it s not your fault and i can t make it worse for you you re awful can t we be happy now sure i brought the whiskey she said hopefully i left some in the bottle one of them can t be sure the other didn t drink it anyway they have another bottle did you bring a blanket for you of course we better get going we re all right if we re going where i think the only thing that makes the pack bigger is my blanket i ll carry the rifle all right what kind of shoes have you i ve got my work moccasins what did you bring to read lorna doone and kidnapped and wuthering heights they re all too old for you but kidnapped lorna doone isn t we ll read it out loud nick said that way it lasts longer but littless you ve made things sort of hard now and we better go those bastards can t be as stupid as they act maybe it was just because they were drinking nick had rolled the pack now and tightened the straps and he sat back and put his moccasins on he put his arm around his sister you sure you want to go i have to go nickie don t be weak and indecisive now i left the note all right nick said let s go you can take the rifle until you get tired of it i m all ready to go his sister said let me help you strap the pack you know you haven t had any sleep at all and that we have to travel i know i m really like the snoring one at the table says he was maybe he was that way once too nick said but what you have to do is keep your feet in good shape do the moccasins chafe no and my feet are tough from going barefoot all summer mine are good too said nick come on let s go they started off walking on the soft hemlock needles and the trees were high and there was no brush between the tree trunks they walked uphill and the moon came through the trees and showed nick with the very big pack and his sister carrying the 22 rifle when they were at the top of the hill they looked back and saw the lake in the moonlight it was clear enough so they could see the dark point and beyond were the high hills of the far shore we might as well say good bye to it nick adams said good bye lake littless said i love you too they went down the hill and across the long field and through the orchard and then through a rail fence and into a field of stubble going through the stubble field they looked to the right and saw the slaughterhouse and the big barn in the hollow and the old log farmhouse on the other high land that overlooked the lake the long road of lombardy poplars that ran to the lake was in the moonlight does it hurt your feet littless nick asked no his sister said i came this way on account of the dogs nick said they d shut up as soon as they knew it was us but somebody might hear them bark i know she said and as soon as they shut up afterwards they d know it was us ahead they could see the dark of the rising line of hills beyond the road they came to the end of one cut field of grain and crossed the little sunken creek that ran down to the springhouse then they climbed across the rise of another stubble field and there was another rail fence and the sandy road with the second growth timber solid beyond it wait till i climb over and i ll help you nick said i want to look at the road from the top of the fence he saw the roll of the country and the dark timber by their own house and the brightness of the lake in the moonlight then he was looking at the road they can t track us the way we ve come and i don t think they would notice tracks in this deep sand he said to his sister we can keep to the two sides of the road if it isn t too scratchy nickie honestly i don t think they re intelligent enough to track anybody look how they just waited for you to come back and then practically got drunk before supper and afterwards they came down to the dock nick said that was where i was if you hadn t told me they would have picked me up they didn t have to be so intelligent to figure you would be on the big creek when our mother let them know you might have gone fishing after i left they must have found all the boats were there and that would make them think you were fishing the creek everybody knows you usually fish below the grist mill and the cider mill they were just slow thinking it out all right nick said but they were awfully close then his sister handed him the rifle through the fence butt toward him and then crawled between the rails she stood beside him on the road and he put his hand on her head and stroked it are you awfully tired littless no i m fine i m too happy to be tired until you re too tired you walk in the sandy part of the road when their horses made holes in the sand it s so soft and dry tracks won t show and i ll walk on the side where it s hard i can walk on the side too no i don t want you to get scratched they climbed but with constant small descents toward the height of land that separated the two lakes there was close heavy second growth timber on both sides of the road and blackberry and raspberry bushes grew from the edge of the road to the timber ahead they could see the top of each hill as a notch in the timber the moon was well on its way down now how do you feel littless nick asked his sister i feel wonderful nickie is it always this nice when you run away from home no usually it s lonesome how lonesome have you ever been bad black lonesome awful do you think you ll get lonesome with me no you don t mind you re with me instead of going to trudy what do you talk about her for all the time i haven t been maybe you were thinking about her and you thought i was talking you re too smart nick said i thought about her because you told me where she was and when i knew where she was i wondered what she would be doing and all that i guess i shouldn t have come i told you that you shouldn t have come oh hell his sister said are we going to be like the others and have fights i ll go back now you don t have to have me shut up nick said please don t say that nickie i ll go back or i ll stay just as you want i ll go back whenever you tell me to but i won t have fights haven t we seen enough fights in families yes said nick i know i forced you to take me but i fixed it so you wouldn t get in trouble about it and i did keep them from catching you they had reached the height of land and from here they could see the lake again although from here it looked narrow now and almost like a big river we cut across country here nick said then we ll hit that old logging road here s where you go back from if you want to go back he took off his pack and put it back into the timber and his sister leaned the rifle on it sit down littless and take a rest he said we re both tired nick lay with his head on the pack and his sister lay by him with her head on his shoulder i m not going back nickie unless you tell me to she said i just don t want fights promise me we won t have fights promise i won t talk about trudy the hell with trudy i want to be useful and a good partner you are you won t mind if i get restless and mix it up with being lonesome no we ll take good care of each other and have fun we can have a lovely time all right we ll start to have it now i ve been having it all the time we just have one pretty hard stretch and then a really hard stretch and then we ll be there we might as well wait until it gets light to start you go to sleep littless are you warm enough oh yes nickie i ve got my sweater she curled up beside him and was asleep in a little while nick was sleeping too he slept for two hours until the morning light woke him nick had circled around through the second growth timber until they had come onto the old logging road we couldn t leave tracks going into it from the main road he told his sister the old road was so overgrown that he had to stoop many times to avoid hitting branches it s like a tunnel his sister said it opens up after a while have i ever been here before no this goes up way beyond where i ever took you hunting does it come out on the secret place no littless we have to go through some long bad slashings nobody gets in where we re going they kept on along the road and then took another road that was even more overgrown then they came out into a clearing there was fireweed and brush in the clearing and the old cabins of the logging camp they were very old and some of the roofs had fallen in but there was a spring by the road and they both drank at it the sun wasn t up yet and they both felt hollow and empty in the early morning after the night of walking all this beyond was hemlock forest nick said they only cut it for the bark and they never used the logs but what happens to the road they must have cut up at the far end first and hauled and piled the bark by the road to snake it out then finally they cut everything right to the road and piled the bark here and then pulled out is the secret place beyond all this slashing yes we go through the slashing and then some more road and then another slashing and then we come to virgin timber how did they leave it when they cut all this i don t know it belonged to somebody that wouldn t sell i guess they stole a lot from the edges and paid stumpage on it but the good part s still there and there isn t any passable road into it but why can t people go down the creek the creek has to come from somewhere they were resting before they started the bad traveling through the slashing and nick wanted to explain look littless the creek crosses the main road we were on and it goes through a farmer s land the farmer has it fenced for a pasture and he runs people off that want to fish so they stop at the bridge on his land on the section of the creek where they would hit if they cut across his pasture on the other side from his house he runs a bull the bull is mean and he really runs everybody off he s the meanest bull i ever saw and he just stays there mean all the time and hunts for people then after him the farmer s land ends and there s a section of cedar swamp with sink holes and you d have to know it to get through and then even if you know it it s bad below that is the secret place we re going in over the hills and sort of in the back way then below the secret place there s real swamp bad swamp that you can t get through now we better start the bad part the bad part and the part that was worse were behind them now nick had climbed over many logs that were higher than his head and others that were up to his waist he would take the rifle and lay it down on the top of the log and pull his sister up and then she would slide down on the far side or he would lower himself down and take the rifle and help the girl down they went over and around piles of brush and it was hot in the slashing and the pollen from the ragweed and the fireweed dusted the girl s hair and made her sneeze damn slashings she said to nick they were resting on top of a big log ringed where they sat by the cutting of the barkpeelers the ring was gray in the rotting gray log and all around were other long gray trunks and gray brush and branches with the brilliant and worthless seeds growing this is the last one nick said i hate them his sister said and the damn weeds are like flowers in a tree cemetery if nobody took care of it you see why i didn t want to try to make it in the dark we couldn t no and nobody s going to chase us through here now we come into the good part they came from the hot sun of the slashings into the shade of the great trees the slashings had run up to the top of a ridge and over and then the forest began they were walking on the brown forest floor now and it was springy and cool under their feet there was no underbrush and the trunks of the trees rose sixty feet high before there were any branches it was cool in the shade of the trees and high up in them nick could hear the breeze that was rising no sun came through as they walked and nick knew there would be no sun through the high top branches until nearly noon his sister put her hand in his and walked close to him i m not scared nickie but it makes me feel very strange me too nick said always i never was in woods like these this is all the virgin timber left around here do we go through it very long quite a way i d be afraid if i were alone it makes me feel strange but i m not afraid i said that first i know maybe we say it because we are afraid no i m not afraid because i m with you but i know i d be afraid alone did you ever come here with anyone else no only by myself and you weren t afraid no but i always feel strange like the way i ought to feel in church nickie where we re going to live isn t as solemn as this is it no don t you worry there it s cheerful you just enjoy this littless this is good for you this is the way forests were in the olden days this is about the last good country there is left nobody gets in here ever i love the olden days but i wouldn t want it all this solemn it wasn t all solemn but the hemlock forests were it s wonderful walking i thought behind our house was wonderful but this is better nickie do you believe in god you don t have to answer if you don t want to i don t know all right you don t have to say it but you don t mind if i say my prayers at night no i ll remind you if you forget thank you because this kind of woods makes me feel awfully religious that s why they build cathedrals to be like this you ve never seen a cathedral have you no but i ve read about them and i can imagine them this is the best one we have around here do you think we can go to europe some time and see cathedrals sure we will but first i have to get out of this trouble and learn how to make some money do you think you ll ever make money writing if i get good enough couldn t you maybe make it if you wrote cheerfuller things that isn t my opinion our mother said everything you write is morbid it s too morbid for the st nicholas nick said they didn t say it but they didn t like it but the st nicholas is our favorite magazine i know said nick but i m too morbid for it already and i m not even grown up when is a man grown up when he s married no until you re grown up they send you to reform school after you re grown up they send you to the penitentiary i m glad you re not grown up then they re not going to send me anywhere nick said and let s not talk morbid even if i write morbid i didn t say it was morbid i know everybody else does though let s be cheerful nickie his sister said these woods make us too solemn we ll be out of them pretty soon nick told her then you ll see where we re going to live are you hungry littless a little i ll bet nick said we ll eat a couple of apples they were coming down a long hill when they saw sunlight ahead through the tree trunks now at the edge of the timber there was wintergreen growing and some partridgeberries and the forest floor began to be alive with growing things through the tree trunks they saw an open meadow that sloped to where white birches grew along the stream below the meadow and the line of the birches there was the dark green of a cedar swamp and far beyond the swamp there were dark blue hills there was an arm of the lake between the swamp and the hills but from here they could not see it they only felt from the distances that it was there here s the spring nick said to his sister and here s the stones where i camped before it s a beautiful beautiful place nickie his sister said can we see the lake too there s a place where we can see it but it s better to camp here i ll get some wood and we ll make breakfast the firestones are very old it s a very old place nick said the firestones are indian how did you come to it straight through the woods with no trail and no blazes didn t you see the direction sticks on the three ridges no i ll show them to you sometime are they yours no they re from the old days why didn t you show them to me i don t know nick said i was showing off i guess nickie they ll never find us here i hope not nick said at about the time that nick and his sister were entering the first of the slashings the warden who was sleeping on the screen porch of the house that stood in the shade of the trees above the lake was wakened by the sun that rising above the slope of open land behind the house shone full on his face during the night the warden had gotten up for a drink of water and when he had come back from the kitchen he had lain down on the floor with a cushion from one of the chairs for a pillow now he waked realized where he was and got to his feet he had slept on his right side because he had a 38 smith and wesson revolver in a shoulder holster under his left armpit now awake he felt for the gun looked away from the sun which hurt his eyes and went into the kitchen where he dipped up a drink of water from the pail beside the kitchen table the hired girl was building a fire in the stove and the warden said to her what about some breakfast no breakfast she said she slept in a cabin out behind the house and had come into the kitchen a half an hour before the sight of the warden lying on the floor of the screen porch and the nearly empty bottle of whiskey on the table had frightened and disgusted her then it had made her angry what do you mean no breakfast the warden said still holding the dipper just that why nothing to eat what about coffee no coffee tea no tea no bacon no corn meal no salt no pepper no coffee no borden s canned cream no aunt jemima buckwheat flour no nothing what are you talking about there was plenty to eat last night there isn t now chipmunks must have carried it away the warden from down state had gotten up when he heard them talking and had come into the kitchen how do you feel this morning the hired girl asked him the warden ignored the hired girl and said what is it evans that son of a bitch came in here last night and got himself a pack load of grub don t you swear in my kitchen the hired girl said come out here the down state warden said they both went out on the screen porch and shut the kitchen door what does that mean evans the down state man pointed at the quart of old green river which had less than a quarter left in it how skunk drunk were you i drank the same as you i sat up by the table doing what waiting for the goddam adams boy if he showed and drinking not drinking then i got up and went in the kitchen and got a drink of water about half past four and i lay down here in front of the door to take it easier why didn t you lie down in front of the kitchen door i could see him better from here if he came so what happened he must have come in the kitchen through a window maybe and loaded that stuff bullshit what were you doing the local warden asked i was sleeping the same as you okay let s quit fighting about it that doesn t do any good tell that hired girl to come out here the hired girl came out and the down state man said to her you tell mrs adams we want to speak to her the hired girl did not say anything but went into the main part of the house shutting the door after her you better pick up the full and the empty bottles the down state man said there isn t enough of this to do any good you want a drink of it no thanks i ve got to work today i ll take one the down state man said it hasn t been shared right i didn t drink any of it after you left the local warden said doggedly why do you keep on with that bullshit it isn t bullshit the down state man put the bottle down all right he said to the hired girl who had opened and shut the door behind her what did she say she has a sick headache and she can t see you she says you have a warrant she says for you to search the place if you want to and then go what did she say about the boy she hasn t seen the boy and she doesn t know anything about him where are the other kids they re visiting at charlevoix who are they visiting i don t know she doesn t know they went to the dance and they were going to stay over sunday with friends who was that kid that was around here yesterday i didn t see any kid around here yesterday there was maybe some friend of the children asking for them maybe some resorter s kid was it a boy or a girl a girl about eleven or twelve brown hair and brown eyes freckles very tanned wearing overalls and a boy s shirt barefooted sounds like anybody the girl said did you say eleven or twelve years old oh shit said the man from down state you can t get anything out of these mossbacks if i m a mossback what s he the hired girl looked at the local warden what s mr evans his kids and me went to the same schoolhouse who was the girl evans asked her come on suzy i can find out anyway i wouldn t know suzy the hired girl said it seems like all kinds of people come by here now i just feel like i m in a big city you don t want to get in any trouble do you suzy evans said no sir i mean it you don t want to get in any trouble either do you suzy asked him out at the barn after they were hitched up the down state man said we didn t do so good did we he s loose now evans said he s got grub and he must have his rifle but he s still in the area i can get him can you track no not really can you in snow the other warden laughed but we don t have to track we have to think out where he ll be he didn t load up with all that stuff to go south he d just take a little something and head for the railway i couldn t tell what was missing from the woodshed but he had a big pack load from the kitchen he s heading in somewhere i got to check on all his habits and his friends and where he used to go you block him off at charlevoix and petoskey and st ignace and sheboygan where would you go if you were him i d go to the upper peninsula me too he s been up there too the ferry is the easiest place to pick him up but there s an awful big country between here and sheboygan and he knows that country too we better go down and see packard we were going to check that today what s to prevent him going down by east jordan and grand traverse nothing but that isn t his country he ll go some place that he knows suzy came out when they were opening the gate in the fence can i ride down to the store with you i ve got to get some groceries what makes you think we re going to the store yesterday you were talking about going to see mr packard how are you going to get your groceries back i guess i can get a lift with somebody on the road or coming up the lake this is saturday all right climb up the local warden said thank you mr evans suzy said at the general store and post office evans hitched the team at the rack and he and the down state man stood and talked before they went in i couldn t say anything with that damned suzy sure packard s a fine man there isn t anybody better liked in this country you d never get a conviction on that trout business against him nobody s going to scare him and we don t want to antagonize him do you think he ll cooperate not if you act rough we ll go see him inside the store suzy had gone straight through past the glass showcases the opened barrels the boxes the shelves of canned goods seeing nothing nor anyone until she came to the post office with its lockboxes and its general delivery and stamp window the window was down and she went straight on to the back of the store mr packard was opening a packing box with a crowbar he looked at her and smiled mr john the hired girl said speaking very fast there s two wardens coming in that s after nickie he cleared out last night and his kid sister s gone with him don t let on about that his mother knows it and it s all right anyhow she isn t going to say anything did he take all your groceries most of them you pick out what you need and make a list and i ll check it over with you they re coming in now you go out the back and come in the front again i ll go and talk to them suzy walked around the long frame building and climbed the front steps again this time she noticed everything as she came in she knew the indians who had brought in the baskets and she knew the two indian boys who were looking at the fishing tackle in the first showcases on the left she knew all the patent medicines in the next case and who usually bought them she had clerked one summer in the store and she knew what the penciled code letters and numbers meant that were on the cardboard boxes that held shoes winter overshoes wool socks mittens caps and sweaters she knew what the baskets were worth that the indians had brought in and that it was too late in the season for them to bring a good price why did you bring them in so late mrs tabeshaw she asked too much fun fourth of july the indian woman laughed how s billy suzy asked i don t know suzy i no see him four weeks now why don t you take them down to the hotel and try to sell them to the resorters suzy said maybe mrs tabeshaw said i took once you ought to take them every day long walk mrs tabeshaw said while suzy was talking to the people she knew and making a list of what she needed for the house the two wardens were in the back of the store with mr john packard mr john had gray blue eyes and dark hair and a dark mustache and he always looked as though he had wandered into a general store by mistake he had been away from northern michigan once for eighteen years when he was a young man and he looked more like a peace officer or an honest gambler than a storekeeper he had owned good saloons in his time and run them well but when the country had been lumbered off he had stayed and bought farming land finally when the county had gone local option he had bought this store he already owned the hotel but he said he didn t like a hotel without a bar and so he almost never went near it mrs packard ran the hotel she was more ambitious than mr john and mr john said he didn t want to waste time with people who had enough money to take a vacation anywhere in the country they wanted and then came to a hotel without a bar and spent their time sitting on the porch in rocking chairs he called the resorters change of lifers and he made fun of them to mrs packard but she loved him and never minded when he teased her i don t mind if you call them change of lifers she told him one night in bed i had the damn thing but i m still all the woman you can handle aren t i she liked the resorters because some of them brought culture and mr john said she loved culture like a lumberjack loved peerless the great chewing tobacco he really respected her love of culture because she said she loved it just like he loved good bonded whiskey and she said packard you don t have to care about culture i won t bother you with it but it makes me feel wonderful mr john said she could have culture until hell wouldn t hold it just so long as he never had to go to a chautauqua or a self betterment course he had been to camp meetings and a revival but he had never been to a chautauqua he said a camp meeting or a revival was bad enough but at least there was some sexual intercourse afterwards by those who got really aroused although he never knew anyone to pay their bills after a camp meeting or a revival mrs packard he told nick adams would get worried about the salvation of his immortal soul after she had been to a big revival by somebody like gypsy smith that great evangelist but finally it would turn out that he packard looked like gypsy smith and everything would be fine finally but a chautauqua was something strange culture maybe was better than religion mr john thought but it was a cold proposition still they were crazy for it he could see it was more than a fad though it s sure got a hold on them he had told nick adams it must be sort of like the holy rollers only in the brain you study it sometime and tell me what you think you going to be a writer you ought to get in on it early don t let them get too far ahead of you mr john liked nick adams because he said he had original sin nick did not understand this but he was proud you re going to have things to repent boy mr john had told nick that s one of the best things there is you can always decide whether to repent them or not but the thing is to have them i don t want to do anything bad nick had said i don t want you to mr john had said but you re alive and you re going to do things don t you lie and don t you steal everybody has to lie but you pick out somebody you never lie to i ll pick out you that s right don t you ever lie to me no matter what and i won t lie to you i ll try nick had said that isn t it mr john said it has to be absolute all right nick said i ll never lie to you what became of your girl somebody said she was working up at the soo she was a beautiful girl and i always liked her mr john had said so did i nick said try and not feel too bad about it i can t help it nick said none of it was her fault she s just built that way if i ran into her again i guess i d get mixed up with her again maybe not maybe too i d try not to mr john was thinking about nick when he went out to the back counter where the two men were waiting for him he looked them over as he stood there and he didn t like either of them he had always disliked the local man evans and had no respect for him but he sensed that the downstate man was dangerous he had not analyzed it yet but he saw the man had very flat eyes and a mouth that was tighter than a simple tobacco chewer s mouth needed to be he had a real elk s tooth too on his watch chain it was a really fine tusk from about a five year old bull it was a beautiful tusk and mr john looked at it again and at the over large bulge the man s shoulder holster made under his coat did you kill that bull with that cannon you re carrying around under your arm mr john asked the down state man the down state man looked at mr john unappreciatively no he said i killed that bull out in the thoroughfare country in wyoming with a winchester 45 70 you re a big gun man eh mr john said he looked under the counter have big feet too do you need that big a cannon when you go out hunting kids what do you mean kids the down state man said he was one ahead i mean the kid you re looking for you said kids the down state man said mr john moved in it was necessary what s evans carry when he goes after a boy who s licked his own boy twice you must be heavily armed evans that boy could lick you too why don t you produce him and we could try it evans said you said kids mr jackson the down state man said what made you say that looking at you you cock sucker mr john said you splayfooted bastard why don t you come out from behind that counter if you want to talk like that the down state man said you re talking to the united states postmaster mr john said you re talking without witnesses except for turd face evans i suppose you know why they call him turd face you

said there ve been other violations but this is the one you ve got proof of that s about it what were the other violations plenty but you haven t got proof i didn t say that evans said but we ve got

re a fine looking woman long time ago mrs tabeshaw said suzy i d like to see you mr john said in the back of the store he said tell me about it i told you already they came for nickie and they waited for him to come home his youngest sister let him know they were waiting for him when they were sleeping drunk nickie got his stuff and pulled out he s got grub for two weeks easy and he s got his rifle and young littless went with him why did she go i don t know mr john i guess she wanted to look after him and keep him from doing anything bad you know him you live up by evans s how much do you think he knows about the country nick uses all he can but i don t know how much where do you think they went i wouldn t know mr john nickie knows a lot of country that man with evans is no good he s really bad he isn t very smart he s smarter than he acts the booze has him down but he s smart and he s bad i used to know him what do you want me to do nothing suzy let me know about anything i ll add up my stuff mr john and you can check it how are you going home i can get the boat up to henry s dock and then get a rowboat from the cottage and row down and get the stuff mr john what will they do with nickie that s what i m worried about they were talking about getting him put in the reform school i wish he hadn t killed that buck so does he he told me he was reading in a book about how you could crease something with a bullet and it wouldn t do any harm it would just stun it and nickie wanted to try it he said it was a damn fool thing to do but he wanted to try it then he hit the buck and broke its neck he felt awful about it he felt awful about trying to crease it in the first place i know then it must have been evans found the meat where he had it hung up in the old springhouse anyway somebody took it who could have told evans i think it was just that boy of his found it he trails around after nick all the time you never see him he could have seen nickie kill the buck that boy s no good mr john but he sure can trail around after anybody he s liable to be in this room right now no said mr john but he could be listening outside i think he s after nick by now the girl said did you hear them say anything about him at the house they never mentioned him suzy said evans must have left him home to do the chores i don t think we have to worry about him till they get home to evans s i can row up the lake to home this afternoon and get one of our kids to let me know if evans hires anyone to do the chores that will mean he s turned that boy loose both the men are too old to trail anybody but that boy s terrible mr john and he knows too much about nickie and where he would go he d find them and then bring the men up to them come in back of the post office mr john said back of the filing slits and the lockboxes and the registry book and the flat stamp books in place along with the cancellation stamps and their pads with the general delivery window down so that suzy felt again the glory of office that had been hers when she had helped out in the store mr john said where do you think they went suzy i wouldn t know true somewhere not too far or he wouldn t take littless somewhere that s really good or he wouldn t take her they know about the trout for trout dinners too mr john that boy sure maybe we better do something about the evans boy i d kill him i m pretty sure that s why littless went along so nickie wouldn t kill him you fix it up so we keep track of them i will but you have to think out something mr john mrs adams she s just broke down she just gets a sick headache like always here you better take this letter you drop it in the box mr john said that s united states mail i wanted to kill them both last night when they were asleep no mr john told her don t talk that way and don t think that way didn t you ever want to kill anybody mr john yes but it s wrong and it doesn t work out my father killed a man it didn t do him any good he couldn t help it you have to learn to help it mr john said you get along now suzy i ll see you tonight or in the morning suzy said i wish i still worked here mr john so do i suzy but mrs packard doesn t see it that way i know said suzy that s the way everything is nick and his sister were lying on a browse bed under a lean to that they had built together on the edge of the hemlock forest looking out over the slope of the hill to the cedar swamp and the blue hills beyond if it isn t comfortable littless we can feather in some more balsam on that hemlock we ll be tired tonight and this will do but we can fix it up really good tomorrow it feels lovely his sister said lie loose and really feel it nickie it s a pretty good camp nick said and it doesn t show we ll only use little fires would a fire show across to the hills it might nick said a fire shows a long way at night but i ll stake out a blanket behind it that way it won t show nickie wouldn t it be nice if there wasn t anyone after us and we were just here for fun don t start thinking that way so soon nick said we just started anyway if we were just here for fun we wouldn t be here i m sorry nickie you don t need to be nick told her look littless i m going down to get a few trout for supper can i come no you stay here and rest you had a tough day you read a while or just be quiet it was tough in the slashings wasn t it i thought it was really hard did i do all right you did wonderfully and you were wonderful making camp but you take it easy now have we got a name for this camp let s call it camp number one nick said he went down the hill toward the creek and when he had come almost to the bank he stopped and cut himself a willow stick about four feet long and trimmed it leaving the bark on he could see the clear fast water of the stream it was narrow and deep and the banks were mossy here before the stream entered the swamp the dark clear water flowed fast and its rushing made bulges on the surface nick did not go close to it as he knew it flowed under the banks and he did not want to frighten a fish by walking on the bank there must be quite a few up here in the open now he thought it s pretty late in the summer he took a coil of silk line out of a tobacco pouch he carried in the left breast pocket of his shirt and cut a length that was not quite as long as the willow stick and fastened it to the tip where he had notched it lightly then he fastened on a hook that he took from the pouch then holding the shank of the hook he tested the pull of the line and the bend of the willow he laid his rod down now and went back to where the trunk of a small birch tree dead for several years lay on its side in the grove of birches that bordered the cedars by the stream he rolled the log over and found several earthworms under it they were not big but they were red and lively and he put them in a flat round tin with holes punched in the top that had once held copenhagen snuff he put some dirt over them and rolled the log back this was the third year he had found bait at this same place and he had always replaced the log so that it was as he had found it nobody knows how big this creek is he thought it picks up an awful volume of water in that bad swamp up above now he looked up the creek and down it and up the hill to the hemlock forest where the camp was then he walked to where he had left the pole with the line and the hook and baited the hook carefully and spat on it for good luck holding the pole and the line with the baited hook in his right hand he walked very carefully and gently toward the bank of the narrow heavy flowing stream it was so narrow here that his willow pole would have spanned it and as he came close to the bank he heard the turbulent rush of the water he stopped by the bank out of sight of anything in the stream and took two lead shot split down one side out of the tobacco pouch and bent them on the line about a foot above the hook clinching them with his teeth he swung the hook on which the two worms curled out over the water and dropped it gently in so that it sank swirling in the fast water and he lowered the tip of the willow pole to let the current take the line and the baited hook under the bank he felt the line straighten and a sudden heavy firmness he swung up on the pole and it bent almost double in his hand he felt the throbbing jerking pull that did not yield as he pulled then it yielded rising in the water with the line there was a heavy wildness of movement in the narrow deep current and the trout was torn out of the water and flopping in the air sailed over nick s shoulder and onto the bank behind him nick saw him shine in the sun and then he found him where he was tumbling in the ferns he was strong and heavy in nick s hands and he had a pleasant smell and nick saw how dark his back was and how brilliant his spots were colored and how bright the edges of his fins were they were white on the edge with a black line behind and then there was the lovely golden sunset color of his belly nick held him in his right hand and he could just reach around him he s pretty big for the skillet he thought but i ve hurt him and i have to kill him he knocked the trout s head sharply against the handle of his hunting knife and laid him against the trunk of a birch tree damn he said he s a perfect size for mrs packard and her trout dinners but he s pretty big for littless and me i better go upstream and find a shallow and try to get a couple of small ones he thought damn didn t he feel like something when i horsed him out though they can talk all they want about playing them but people that have never horsed them out don t know what they can make you feel what if it only lasts that long it s the time when there s no give at all and then they start to come and what they do to you on the way up and into the air this is a strange creek he thought it s funny when you have to hunt for small ones he found his pole where he had thrown it the hook was bent and he straightened it then he picked up the heavy fish and started up the stream there s one shallow pebbly part just after she comes out of the upper swamp he thought i can get a couple of small ones there littless might not like this big one if she gets homesick i ll have to take her back i wonder what those old boys are doing now i don t think that goddam evans kid knows about this place that son of a bitch i don t think anybody fished in here but indians you should have been an indian he thought it would have saved you a lot of trouble he made his way up the creek keeping back from the stream but once stepping onto a piece of bank where the stream flowed underground a big trout broke out in a violence that made a slashing wake in the water he was a trout so big that it hardly seemed he could turn in the stream when did you come up nick said when the fish had gone under the bank again further upstream boy what a trout at the pebbly shallow stretch he caught two small trout they were beautiful fish too firm and hard and he gutted the three fish and tossed the guts into the stream then washed the trout carefully in the cold water and then wrapped them in a small faded sugar sack from his pocket it s a good thing that girl likes fish he thought i wish we could have picked some berries i know where i can always get some though he started back up the hill slope toward their camp the sun was down behind the hill and the weather was good he looked out across the swamp and up in the sky above where the arm of the lake would be he saw a fish hawk flying he came up to the lean to very quietly and his sister did not hear him she was lying on her side reading seeing her he spoke softly not to startle her what did you do you monkey she turned and looked at him and smiled and shook her head i cut it off she said how with a scissors how did you think how did you see to do it i just held it out and cut it it s easy do i look like a boy like a wild boy of borneo i couldn t cut it like a sunday school boy does it look too wild no it s very exciting she said now i m your sister but i m a boy too do you think it will change me into a boy no i wish it would you re crazy littless maybe i am do i look like an idiot boy a little you can make it neater you can see to cut it with a comb i ll have to make it a little better but not much are you hungry idiot brother can t i just be an un idiot brother i don t want to trade you for a brother you have to now nickie don t you see it was something we had to do i should have asked you but i knew it was something we had to do so i did it for a surprise i like it nick said the hell with everything i like it very much thank you nickie so much i was laying trying to rest like you said but all i could do was imagine things to do for you i was going to get you a chewing tobacco can full of knockout drops from some big saloon in some place like sheboygan who did you get them from nick was sitting down now and his sister sat on his lap and held her arms around his neck and rubbed her cropped head against his cheek i got them from the queen of the whores she said and you know the name of the saloon no the royal ten dollar gold piece inn and emporium what did you do there i was a whore s assistant what s a whore s assistant do oh she carries the whore s train when she walks and opens her carriage door and shows her to the right room it s like a lady in waiting i guess what s she say to the whore she ll say anything that comes into her mind as long as it s polite like what brother like well ma am it must be pretty tiring on a hot day like today to be just a bird in a gilded cage things like that what s the whore say she says yes indeedy it sure is sweetness because this whore i was whore s assistant to is of humble origin what kind of origin are you i m the sister or the brother of a morbid writer and i m delicately brought up this makes me intensely desirable to the main whore and to all of her circle did you get the knockout drops of course she said hon take these little old drops thank you i said give my regards to your morbid brother and ask him to stop by the emporium anytime he is at sheboygan get off my lap nick said that s just the way they talk in the emporium littless said i have to get supper aren t you hungry i ll get supper no nick said you keep on talking don t you think we re going to have fun nickie we re having fun now do you want me to tell you about the other thing i did for you you mean before you decided to do something practical and cut off your hair this was practical enough wait till you hear it can i kiss you while you re making supper wait a while and i ll tell you what was it you were going to do well i guess i was ruined morally last night when i stole the whiskey do you think you can be ruined morally by just one thing like that no anyway the bottle was open yes but i took the empty pint bottle and the quart bottle with the whiskey in it out to the kitchen and i poured the pint bottle full and some spilled on my hand and i licked it off and i thought that probably ruined me morally how d it taste awfully strong and funny and a little sick making that wouldn t ruin you morally well i m glad because if i was ruined morally how could i exercise a good influence on you i don t know nick said what was it you were going to do he had his fire made and the skillet resting on it and he was laying strips of bacon in the skillet his sister was watching and she had her hands folded across her knees and he watched her unclasp her hands and put one arm down and lean on it and put her legs out straight she was practicing being a boy i ve got to learn to put my hands right keep them away from your head i know it would be easy if there was some boy my own age to copy copy me that would be natural wouldn t it you won t laugh though maybe gee i hope i won t start to be a girl while we re on the trip don t worry we have the same shoulders and the same kind of legs what was the other thing you were going to do nick was cooking the trout now the bacon was curled brown on a fresh cut chip of wood from the piece of fallen timber they were using for the fire and they both smelled the trout cooking in the bacon fat nick basted them and then turned them and basted them again it was getting dark and he had rigged a piece of canvas behind the little fire so that it would not be seen what were you going to do he asked again littless leaned forward and spat toward the fire how was that you missed the skillet anyway oh it s pretty bad i got it out of the bible i was going to take three spikes one for each of them and drive them into the temples of those two and that boy while they slept what were you going to drive them in with a muffled hammer how do you muffle a hammer i d muffle it all right that nail thing s pretty rough to try well that girl did it in the bible and since i ve seen armed men drunk and asleep and circulated among them at night and stolen their whiskey why shouldn t i go the whole way especially if i learned it in the bible they didn t have a muffled hammer in the bible i guess i mixed it up with muffled oars maybe and we don t want to kill anybody that s why you came along i know but crime comes easy for you and me nickie we re different from the others then i thought if i was ruined morally i might as well be useful you re crazy littless he said listen does tea keep you awake i don t know i never had it at night only peppermint tea i ll make it very weak and put canned cream in it i don t need it nickie if we re short it will just give the milk a little taste they were eating now nick had cut them each two slices of rye bread and he soaked one slice for each in the bacon fat in the skillet they ate that and the trout that were crisp outside and cooked well and very tender inside then they put the trout skeletons in the fire and ate the bacon made in a sandwich with the other piece of bread and then littless drank the weak tea with the condensed milk in it and nick tapped two slivers of wood into the holes he had punched in the can did you have enough plenty the trout was wonderful and the bacon too weren t we lucky they had rye bread eat an apple he said maybe we ll have something good tomorrow maybe i should have made a bigger supper littless no i had plenty you re sure you re not hungry no i m full i ve got some chocolate if you d like some where d you get it from my savior where my savior where i save everything oh this is fresh some is the hard kind from the kitchen we can start on that and save the other for sometime special look my savior s got a drawstring like a tobacco pouch we can use it for nuggets and things like that do you think we ll get out west nickie on this trip i haven t got it figured yet i d like to get my savior packed full of nuggets worth sixteen dollars an ounce nick cleaned up the skillet and put the pack in at the head of the leanto one blanket was spread over the browse bed and he put the other one on it and tucked it under on littless s side he cleaned out the two quart tin pail he d made tea in and filled it with cold water from the spring when he came back from the spring his sister was in the bed asleep her head on the pillow she had made by rolling her blue jeans around her moccasins he kissed her but she did not wake and he put on his old mackinaw coat and felt in the packsack until he found the pint bottle of whiskey he opened it and smelled it and it smelled very good he dipped a half a cup of water out of the small pail he had brought from the spring and poured a little of the whiskey in it then he sat and sipped this very slowly letting it stay under his tongue before he brought it slowly back over his tongue and swallowed it he watched the small coals of the fire brighten with the light evening breeze and he tasted the whiskey and cold water and looked at the coals and thought then he finished the cup dipped up some cold water and drank it and went to bed the rifle was under his left leg and his head was on the good hard pillow his moccasins and the rolled trousers made and he pulled his side of the blanket tight around him and said his prayers and went to sleep in the night he was cold and he spread his mackinaw coat over his sister and rolled his back over closer to her so that there was more of his side of the blanket under him he felt for the gun and tucked it under his leg again the air was cold and sharp to breathe and he smelled the cut hemlock and balsam boughs he had not realized how tired he was until the cold had waked him now he lay comfortable again feeling the warmth of his sister s body against his back and he thought i must take good care of her and keep her happy and get her back safely he listened to her breathing and to the quiet of the night and then he was asleep again it was just light enough to see the far hills beyond the swamp when he woke he lay quietly and stretched the stiffness from his body then he sat up and pulled on his khaki trousers and put on his moccasins he watched his sister sleeping with the collar of the warm mackinaw coat under her chin and her high cheekbones and brown freckled skin light rose under the brown her chopped off hair showing the beautiful line of her head and emphasizing her straight nose and her close set ears he wished he could draw her face and he watched the way her long lashes lay on her cheeks she looks like a small wild animal he thought and she sleeps like one how would you say her head looks he thought i guess the nearest is that it looks as though someone had cut her hair off on a wooden block with an ax it has a sort of a carved look he loved his sister very much and she loved him too much but he thought i guess those things straighten out at least i hope so there s no sense waking anyone up he thought she must have been really tired if i m as tired as i am if we are all right here we are doing just what we should do staying out of sight until things quiet down and that down state man pulls out i ve got to feed her better though it s a shame i couldn t have outfitted really good we ve got a lot of things though the pack was heavy enough but what we want to get today is berries i better get a partridge or a couple if i can we can get good mushrooms too we ll have to be careful about the bacon but we won t need it with the shortening maybe i fed her too light last night she s used to lots of milk too and sweet things don t worry about it we ll feed good it s a good thing she likes trout they were really good don t worry about her she ll eat wonderfully but nick boy you certainly didn t feed her too much yesterday better to let her sleep than to wake her up now there s plenty for you to do he started to get some things out of the pack very carefully and his sister smiled in her sleep the brown skin came taut over her cheekbones when she smiled and the undercolor showed she did not wake and he started to prepare to make breakfast and get the fire ready there was plenty of wood cut and he built a very small fire and made tea while he waited to start breakfast he drank his tea straight and ate three dried apricots and he tried to read in lorna doone but he had read it and it did not have magic any more and he knew it was a loss on this trip late in the afternoon when they had made camp he had put some prunes in a tin pail to soak and he put them on the fire now to stew in the pack he found the prepared buckwheat flour and he put it out with an enameled saucepan and a tin cup to mix the flour with water to make a batter he had the tin of vegetable shortening and he cut a piece off the top of an empty flour sack and wrapped it around a cut stick and tied it tight with a piece of fish line littless had brought four old flour sacks and he was proud of her he mixed the batter and put the skillet on the fire greasing it with the shortening which he spread with the cloth on the stick first it made the skillet shine darkly then it sizzled and spat and he greased again and poured the batter smoothly and watched it bubble and then start to firm around the edges he watched the rising and the forming of the texture and the gray color of the cake he loosened it from the pan with a fresh clean chip and flipped it and caught it the beautiful browned side up the other sizzling he could feel its weight but see it growing in buoyancy in the skillet good morning his sister said did i sleep awfully late no devil she stood up with her shirt hanging down over her brown legs you ve done everything no i just started the cakes doesn t that one smell wonderful i ll go to the spring and wash and come and help don t wash in the spring i m not white man she said she was gone behind the lean to where did you leave the soap she asked it s by the spring there s an empty lard bucket bring the butter will you it s in the spring i ll be right back there was a half a pound of butter and she brought it wrapped in the oiled paper in the empty lard bucket they ate the buckwheat cakes with butter and log cabin syrup out of a tin log cabin can the top of the chimney unscrewed and the syrup poured from the chimney they were both very hungry and the cakes were delicious with the butter melting on them and running down into the cut places with the syrup they ate the prunes out of the tin cups and drank the juice then they drank tea from the same cups prunes taste like a celebration littless said think of that how did you sleep nickie good thank you for putting the mackinaw on me wasn t it a lovely night though yes did you sleep all night i m still asleep nickie can we stay here always i don t think so you d grow up and have to get married i m going to get married to you anyway i want to be your common law wife i read about it in the paper that s where you read about the unwritten law sure i m going to be your common law wife under the unwritten law can t i nickie no i will i ll surprise you all you have to do is live a certain time as man and wife i ll get them to count this time now it s just like homesteading i won t let you file you can t help yourself that s the unwritten law i ve thought it out lots of times i ll get cards printed mrs nick adams cross village michigan common law wife i ll hand these out to a few people openly each year until the time s up i don t think it would work i ve got another scheme we ll have a couple of children while i m a minor then you have to marry me under the unwritten law that s not the unwritten law i get mixed up on it anyway nobody knows yet if it works it must she said mr thaw is counting on it mr thaw might make a mistake why nickie mr thaw practically invented the unwritten law i thought it was his lawyer well mr thaw put in the action anyway i don t like mr thaw nick adams said that s good there s things about him i don t like either but he certainly made the paper more interesting reading didn t he he gives the others something new to hate they hate mr stanford white too i think they re jealous of both of them i believe that s true nickie just like they re jealous of us think anybody is jealous of us now not right now maybe our mother will think we re fugitives from justice steeped in sin and iniquity it s a good thing she doesn t know i got you that whiskey i tried it last night it s very good oh i m glad that s the first whiskey i ever stole anywhere isn t it wonderful that it s good i didn t think anything about those people could be good i ve got to think about them too much let s not talk about them nick said all right what are we going to do today what would you like to do i d like to go to mr john s store and get everything we need we can t do that i know it what do you plan to really do we ought to get some berries and i ought to get a partridge or some partridges we ve always got trout but i don t want you to get tired of trout were you ever tired of trout no but they say people get tired of them i wouldn t get tired of them littless said you get tired of pike right away but you never get tired of trout nor of perch i know nickie true you don t get tired of walleyed pike either nick said only of shovelnose boy you sure get tired of them i don t like the pitchfork bones his sister said it s a fish that surfeits you we ll clean up here and i ll find a place to cache the shells and we ll make a trip for berries and try to get some birds i ll bring two lard pails and a couple of the sacks his sister said littless nick said you remember about going to the bathroom will you please of course that s important i know it you remember too i will nick went back into the timber and buried the carton of 22 long rifles and the loose boxes of 22 shorts under the brown needled floor at the base of a big hemlock he put back the packed needles he had cut with his knife and made a small cut as far up as he could reach on the heavy bark of the tree he took a bearing on the tree and then came out onto the hillside and walked down to the lean to it was a lovely morning now the sky was high and clear blue and no clouds had come yet nick was happy with his sister and he thought no matter how this thing comes out we might as well have a good happy time he had already learned there was only one day at a time and that it was always the day you were in it would be today until it was tonight and tomorrow would be today again this was the main thing he had learned so far today was a good day and coming down to the camp with his rifle he was happy although their trouble was like a fishhook caught in his pocket that pricked him occasionally as he walked they left the pack inside the lean to there were great odds against a bear bothering it in the daytime because any bear would be down below feeding on berries around the swamp but nick buried the bottle of whiskey up behind the spring littless was not back yet and nick sat down on the log of the fallen tree they were using for firewood and checked his rifle they were going after partridges so he pulled out the tube of the magazine and poured the long rifle cartridges into his hand and then put them into a chamois pouch and filled the magazine with 22 shorts they made less noise and would not tear the meat up if he could not get head shots he was all ready now and wanted to start where s that girl anyway he thought then he thought don t get excited you told her to take her time don t get nervous but he was nervous and it made him angry at himself here i am his sister said i m sorry that i took so long i went too far away i guess you re fine nick said let s go you have the pails uh huh and covers too they started down across the hill to the creek nick looked carefully up the stream and along the hillside his sister watched him she had the pails in one of the sacks and carried it slung over her shoulder by the other sack aren t you taking a pole nickie she asked him no i ll cut one if we fish he moved ahead of his sister holding the rifle in one hand keeping a little way away from the stream he was hunting now it s a strange creek his sister said it s the biggest small stream i ve ever known nick told her it s deep and scary for a little stream it keeps having new springs nick said and it digs under the bank and it digs down it s awful cold water littless feel it gee she said it was numbing cold the sun warms it a little nick said but not much we ll hunt along easy there s a berry patch down below they went along down the creek nick was studying the banks he had seen a mink s track and shown it to his sister and they had seen tiny rubycrowned kinglets that were hunting insects and let the boy and girl come close as they moved sharply and delicately in the cedars they had seen cedar waxwings so calm and gentle and distinguished moving in their lovely elegance with the magic wax touches on their wing coverts and their tails and littless had said they re the most beautiful nickie there couldn t be more simply beautiful birds they re built like your face he said no nickie don t make fun cedar waxwings make me so proud and happy that i cry when they wheel and light and then move so proud and friendly and gently nick said they had gone on and suddenly nick had raised the rifle and shot before his sister could see what he was looking at then she heard the sound of a big bird tossing and beating its wings on the ground she saw nick pumping the gun and shoot twice more and each time she heard another pounding of wings in the willow brush then there was the whirring noise of wings as large brown birds burst out of the willows and one bird flew only a little way and lit in the willows and with its crested head on one side looked down bending the collar of feathers on his neck where the other birds were still thumping the bird looking down from the red willow brush was beautiful plump heavy and looked so stupid with his head turned down and as nick raised his rifle slowly his sister whispered no nickie please no we ve got plenty all right nick said you want to take him no nickie no nick went forward into the willows and picked up the three grouse and batted their heads against the butt of the rifle stock and laid them out on the moss his sister felt them warm and 7ullbreasted and beautifully feathered wait till we eat them nick said he was very happy i m sorry for them now his sister said they were enjoying the morning just like we were she looked up at the grouse still in the tree it does look a little silly still staring down she said this time of year the indians call them fool hens after they ve been hunted they get smart they re not the real fool hens those never get smart they re willow grouse these are ruffled grouse i hope we ll get smart his sister said tell him to go away nickie you tell him go away partridge the grouse did not move nick raised the rifle and the grouse looked at him nick knew he could not shoot the bird without making his sister sad and he made a noise blowing out so his tongue rattled and lips shook like a grouse bursting from cover and the bird looked at him fascinated we better not annoy him nick said i m sorry nickie his sister said he is stupid wait till we eat them nick told her you ll see why we hunt them are they out of season too sure but they are full grown and nobody but us would ever hunt them i kill plenty of great horned owls and a great homed owl will kill a partridge every day if he can they hunt all the time and they kill all the good birds he certainly could kill that one easy his sister said i don t feel bad any more do you want a bag to carry them in i ll draw them and then pack them in the bag with some ferns it isn t so far to the berries now they sat against one of the cedars and nick opened the birds and took out their warm entrails and feeling the inside of the birds hot on his right hand he found the edible pans of the giblets and cleaned them and then washed them in the stream when the birds were cleaned he smoothed their feathers and wrapped them in ferns and put them in the flour sack he tied the mouth of the flour sack and two comers with a piece of fish line and slung it over his shoulder and then went back to the stream and dropped the entrails in and tossed some bright pieces of lung in to see the trout rise in the rapid heavy flow of the water they d make good bait but we don t need bait now he said our trout are all in the stream and we ll take them when we need them this stream would make us rich if it was near home his sister said it would be fished out then this is the last really wild stream there is except in another awful country to get to beyond the foot of the lake i never brought anybody here to fish who ever fishes it nobody i know is it a virgin stream no indians fish it but they re gone now since they quit cutting hemlock bark and the camps closed down does the evans boy know not him nick said but then he thought about it and it made him feel sick he could see the evans boy what re you thinking nickie i wasn t thinking you were thinking you tell me we re partners he might know nick said goddam it he might know but you don t know that he knows no that s the trouble if i did i d get out maybe he s back at camp now his sister said don t talk that way do you want to bring him no she said please nickie i m sorry i brought it up i m not nick said i m grateful i knew it anyway only i d stopped thinking about it i have to think about things now the rest of my life you always thought about things not like this let s go down and get the berries anyway littless said there isn t anything we can do now to help is there no nick said we ll pick the berries and get back to camp but nick was trying to accept it now and think his way all the way through it he must not get in a panic about it nothing had changed things were just as they were when he had decided to come here and let things blow over the evans boy could have followed him here before but it was very unlikely he could have followed him one time when he had gone in from the road through the hodges place but it was doubtful nobody had been fishing the stream he could be sure of that but the evans boy did not care about fishing all that bastard cares about is trailing me he said i know it nickie this is three times he s made trouble i know it nickie but don t you kill him that s why she came along nick thought that s why she s here i can t do it while she s along i know i mustn t kill him he said there s nothing we can do now let s not talk about it as long as you don t kill him his sister said there s nothing we can t get out of and nothing that won t blow over let s get back to camp nick said without the berries we ll get the berries another day are you nervous nickie yes i m sorry but what good will we be back at camp we ll know quicker can t we just go along the way we were going not now i m not scared littless and don t you be scared but something s made me nervous nick had cut up away from the stream into the edge of the timber and they were walking in the shade of the trees they would come onto the camp now from above from the timber they approached the camp carefully nick went ahead with the rifle the camp had not been visited you stay here nick told his sister i m going to have a look beyond he left the sack with the birds and the berry pails with littless and went well upstream as soon as he was out of sight of his sister he changed the 22 shorts in the rifle for the long rifles i won t kill him he thought but anyway it s the right thing to do he made a careful search of the country he saw no sign of anyone and he went down to the stream and then downstream and back up to the camp i m sorry i was nervous littless he said we might as well have a good lunch and then we won t have to worry about a fire showing at night i m worried now too she said don t you be worried it s just like it was before but he drove us back from getting the berries without him even being here i know but he s not been here maybe he s never even been to this creek ever maybe we ll never see him again he makes me scared nickie worse when he s not here than when he s here i know but there isn t any use being scared what are we going to do well we better wait to cook until night why did you change he won t be around here at night he can t come through the swamp in the dark we don t have to worry about him early in the mornings and late in the evening nor in the dark we ll have to be like the deer and only be out then we ll lay up in the daytime maybe he ll never come sure maybe but i can stay though can t i i ought to get you home no please nickie who s going to keep you from killing him then listen littless don t ever talk about killing and remember i never talked about killing there isn t any killing nor ever going to be any true true i m so glad don t even be that nobody ever talked about it all right i never thought about it nor spoke about it me either of course you didn t i never even thought about it no he thought you never even thought about it only all day and all night but you mustn t think about it in front of her because she can feel it because she is your sister and you love each other are you hungry littless not really eat some of the hard chocolate and i ll get some fresh water from the spring i don t have to have anything they looked across to where the big white clouds of the eleven o clock breeze were coming up over the blue hills beyond the swamp the sky was a high clear blue and the clouds came up white and detached themselves from behind the hills and moved high in the sky as the breeze freshened and the shadows of the clouds moved over the swamp and across the hillside the wind blew in the trees now and was cool as they lay in the shade the water from the spring was cold and fresh in the tin pail and the chocolate was not quite bitter but was hard and crunched as they chewed it it s as good as the water in the spring where we were when we first saw them his sister said it tastes even better after the chocolate we can cook if you re hungry i m not if you re not i m always hungry i was a fool not to go on and get the berries no you came back to find out look littless i know a good place back by the slashing we came through where we can get berries i ll cache everything and we can go in there through the timber all the way and pick a couple of pails full and then we ll have them ahead for tomorrow it isn t a bad walk all right but i m fine aren t you hungry no not at all now after the chocolate i d love to just stay and read we had a nice walk when we were hunting all right nick said are you tired from yesterday maybe a little we ll take it easy i ll read wuthering heights is it too old to read out loud to me no will you read it sure an african story he was waiting forthe moon to rise and he felt kibo s hair rise under his hand as he stroked him to be quiet and they both watched and listened as the moon came up and gave them shadows his arm was around the dog s neck now and he could feel him shivering all of the night sounds had stopped they did not hear the elephant and david did not see him until the dog turned his head and seemed to settle into david then the elephant s shadow covered them and he moved past making no noise at all and they smelled him in the light wind that came down from the mountain he smelled strong but old and sour and when he was past david saw that the left tusk was so long it seemed to reach the ground they waited but no other elephants came by and then david and the dog started off running in the moonlight the dog kept close behind him and when david stopped the dog pressed his muzzle into the back of his knee david had to see the bull again and they came up on him at the edge of the forest he was traveling toward the mountain and slowly moving into the steady night breeze david came close enough to see him cut off the moon again and to smell the sour oldness but he could not see the right tusk he was afraid to work closer with the dog and he took him back with the wind and pushed him down against the base of a tree and tried to make him understand he thought the dog would stay and he did but when david moved up toward the bulk of the elephant again he felt the wet muzzle against the hollow of his knee the two of them followed the elephant until he came to an opening in the trees he stood there moving his huge ears his bulk was in the shadow but the moonlight would be on his head david reached behind him and closed the dog s jaws gently with his hand and then moved softly and unbreathing to his right along the edge of the night breeze feeling it on his cheek edging with it never letting it get between him and the bulk until he could see the elephant s head and the great ears slowly moving the right tusk was as thick as his own thigh and it curved down almost to the ground he and kibo moved back the wind on his neck now and they backtracked out of the forest and into the open park country the dog was ahead of him now and he stopped where david had left the two hunting spears by the trail when they had followed the elephant he swung them over his shoulder in their thong and leather cup harness and with his best spear that he had kept with him all the time in his hand they started on the trail for the shamba the moon was high now and he wondered why there was no drumming from the shamba something was strange if his father was there and there was no drumming david had felt the tiredness as soon as they had picked up the trail again for a long time he had been fresher and in better shape than the two men and impatient with their slow trailing and the regular halts his father made each hour on the hour he could have moved ahead much faster than juma and his father but when he started to tire they were the same as ever and at noon they took only the usual five minute rest and he had seen that juma was increasing the pace a little perhaps he wasn t perhaps it had only seemed faster but the elephant dung was fresher now although it was not warm yet to the touch juma gave him the rifle to carry after they came upon the last pile of dung but after an hour he looked at him and took it back they had been climbing steadily across a slope of the mountain but now the trail went down and from a gap in the forest he saw broken country ahead here s where the tough part starts davey his father said it was then he knew that he should have been sent back to the shamba once he had put them on the trail juma had known it for a long time his father knew it now and there was nothing to be done it was another of his mistakes and there was nothing to do now except gamble david looked down at the big flattened circle of the print of the elephant s foot and saw where the bracken had been pressed down and where a broken stem of a weed was drying juma picked it up and looked at the sun juma handed the broken weed to david s father and his father rolled it in his fingers david noticed the white flowers that were drooped and dying but they still had not dried in the sun nor shed their petals it s going to be a bitch his father said let s get going late in the afternoon they were still tracking through the broken country he had been sleepy now for a long time and as he watched the two men he knew that sleepiness was his real enemy and he followed their pace and tried to move through and out of the sleep that deadened him the two men relieved each other tracking on the hour and the one who was in second place looked back at him at regular intervals to check if he was with them when they made a dry camp at dark in the forest he went to sleep as soon as he sat down and woke with juma holding his moccasins and feeling his bare feet for blisters his father had spread his coat over him and was sitting by him with a piece of cold cooked meat and two biscuits he offered him a water bottle with cold tea he ll have to feed davey his father said your feet are in good shape they re as sound as juma s eat this slowly and drink some tea and go to sleep again we haven t any problems i m sorry i was so sleepy you and kibo hunted and traveled all last night why shouldn t you be sleepy you can have a little more meat if you want it i m not hungry good we re good for three days we ll hit water again tomorrow plenty of creeks come off the mountain where s he going juma thinks he knows isn t it bad not too bad davey i m going back to sleep david had said i don t need your coat juma and i are all right his father said i always sleep warm you know david was asleep even before his father said good night then he woke once with the moonlight on his face and he thought of the elephant with his great ears moving as he stood in the forest his head hung down with the weight of the tusks david thought then in the night that the hollow way he felt as he remembered him was from waking hungry but it was not and he found that out in the next three days the next day was very bad because long before noon he knew that it was not just the need for sleep that made the difference between a boy and men for the first three hours he was fresher than they were and he asked juma for the 303 rifle to carry but juma shook his head he did not smile and he had always been david s best friend and had taught him to hunt he offered it to me yesterday david thought and i m in better shape today than i was then he was too but by ten o clock he knew the day would be as bad or worse than the day before it was as silly for him to think that he could trail with his father as to think he could fight with him he knew too that it was not just that they were men they were professional hunters and he knew now that was why juma would not even waste a smile they knew everything the elephant had done pointed out the signs of it to each other without speaking and when the tracking became difficult his father always yielded to juma when they stopped to fill the water bottles at a stream his father said just last the day out davey then when they were past the broken country and climbing toward the forest the tracks of the elephant turned off to the right onto an old elephant trail he saw his father and juma talking and when he got up to them juma was looking back over the way they had come and then at a far distant stony island of hills in the dry country and seemed to be taking a bearing of this against the peaks of three far blue hills on the horizon juma knows where he s going now his father explained he thought he knew before but then he dropped down into this stuff he looked back at the country they had come through all day where he s headed now is pretty good going but we ll have to climb they climbed until it was dark and then made another dry camp david killed two spur fowl with his slingshot out of a small flock that had walked across the trail just before the sunset the birds had come into the old elephant trail to dust walking neatly and plumply and when the pebble broke the back of one and the bird began to jerk and toss with its wings thumping another bird ran forward to peck at it and david pouched another pebble and pulled it back and sent it against the ribs of the second bird as he ran forward to put his hand on it the other birds whirred off juma had looked back and smiled this time and david picked up the two birds warm and plump and smoothly feathered and knocked their heads against the handle of his hunting knife now where they were camped for the night his father said i ve never seen that type of francolin quite so high you did very well to get a double on them juma cooked the birds spitted on a stick over the coals of a very small fire his father drank a whiskey and water from the cup top on his flask as they lay and watched juma cook afterward juma gave them each a breast with the heart in it and ate the two necks and backs and the legs himself it makes a great difference davey his father said we re very well off on rations now how far are we behind him david asked we re quite close his father said it depends on whether he travels when the moon comes up it s an hour later tonight and two hours later than when you found him why does juma think he knows where he s going he wounded him and killed his askari not too far from here when five years ago he says that may mean anytime when you were still a toto he says has he been alone since then he says so he hasn t seen him only heard of him how big does he say he is close to two hundred bigger than anything i ve ever seen he says there s only been one greater elephant and he came from near here too i d better get to sleep david said i hope i ll be better tomorrow you were splendid today his father said i was very proud of you so was juma in the night when he woke after the moon was up he was sure they were not proud of him except perhaps for his dexterity in killing the two birds he had found the elephant at night and followed him to see that he had both of his tusks and then returned to find the two men and put them on the trail david knew they were proud of that but once the deadly following started he was useless to them and a danger to their success just as kibo had been to him when he had gone up close to the elephant in the night and he knew they must each have hated themselves for not having sent him back when there was time the tusks of the elephant weighed two hundred pounds apiece ever since these tusks had grown beyond their normal size the elephant had been hunted for them and now the three of them would kill him for them david was sure that they would kill him now because he david had lasted through the day and kept up after the pace had destroyed him by noon so they probably were proud of him doing that but he had brought nothing useful to the hunt and they would have been far better off without him many times during the day he had wished that he had never betrayed the elephant and in the afternoon he remembered wishing that he had never seen him awake in the moonlight he knew that was not true the next morning they were following the spoor of the elephant on an old elephant trail that was a hard packed worn road through the forest it looked as though elephants had traveled it ever since the lava had cooled from the mountain and the trees had first grown tall and close juma was very confident and they moved fast both his father and juma seemed very sure of themselves and the going on the elephant road was so easy that juma gave him the 303 to carry as they went on through the broken light of the forest then they lost the trail in smoking piles of fresh dung and the flat round prints of a herd of elephants that had come onto the elephant road from the heavy forest on the left of the trail juma had taken the 303 from david angrily it was afternoon before they worked up to the herd and around it seeing the gray bulks through the trees and the movement of the big ears and the searching trunks coiling and uncoiling hearing the crash of branches broken the crash of trees pushed over the rumbling in the bellies of the elephants and the slap and thud of the dung falling they had found the trail of the old bull finally and when it turned off onto a smaller elephant road juma had looked at david s father and grinned showing his filed teeth and his father had nodded his head they looked as though they had a dirty secret just as they had looked when he had found them that night at the shamba it was not very long before they came on the secret it was off to the right in the forest and the tracks of the old bull led to it it was a skull as high as david s chest and white from the sun and the rain there was a deep depression in the forehead and a ridge ran from between the bare white eye sockets and flared out in empty broken holes where the tusks had been chopped away juma pointed out where the great elephant they were trailing had stood while he looked down at the skull and where his trunk had moved it a little way from the place it had rested on the ground and where the points of his tusks had touched the ground beside it he showed david the single hole in the big depression in the white bone of the forehead and then the four holes close together in the bone around the earhole he grinned at david and at his father and took a 303 solid from his pocket and fitted the nose into the hole in the bone of the forehead here is where juma wounded the big bull his father said this was his askari his friend really because he was a big bull too he charged and juma knocked him down and finished him in the ear juma was pointing out the scattered bones and how the big bull had walked among them juma and david s father were both very pleased with what they had found how long do you suppose he and his friend had been together david asked his father i haven t the faintest idea his father said ask juma you ask him please his father and juma spoke together and juma had looked at david and laughed probably four or five times your life he says david s father told him he doesn t know or care really i care david thought i saw him in the moonlight and he was alone but i had kibo kibo has me too the bull wasn t doing any harm and now we ve tracked him to where he came to see his dead friend and now we re going to kill him it s my fault i betrayed him now juma had worked out the trail and motioned to his father and they started on my father doesn t need to kill elephants to live david thought juma would not have found him if i had not seen him he had his chance at him and all he did was wound him and kill his friend kibo and i found him and i never should have told them and i should have kept him secret and had him always and let them stay drunk at the beer shamba juma was so drunk we could not wake him i m going to keep everything a secret always i ll never tell them anything again if they kill him juma will drink his share of the ivory or just buy himself another goddamn wife why didn t you help the elephant when you could all you had to do was not go on the second day no that wouldn t have stopped them juma would have gone on you never should have told them never never tell them try and remember that never tell anyone anything ever never tell anyone anything again his father waited for him to come up and said very gently he rested here he s not traveling as he was we ll be up on him anytime now fuck elephant hunting david had said very quietly what s that his father asked fuck elephant hunting david said softly be careful you don t fuck it up his father had said to him and looked at him flatly that s one thing david had thought he s not stupid he knows all about it now and he will never trust me again that s good i don t want him to because i ll never ever tell him or anybody anything again never anything again never ever never in the morning he was on the far slope of the mountain again the elephant was no longer traveling as he had been but was moving aimlessly now feeding occasionally and david had known they were getting close to him he tried to remember how he had felt he had no love for the elephant yet he must remember that he had only a sorrow that had come from his own tiredness that had brought an understanding of age through being too young he had learned how it must be to be too old he was lonesome for kibo and thinking of how juma killing the elephant s friend had turned him against juma and made the elephant his brother he knew then how much it meant to him to have seen the elephant in the moonlight and to have followed him and come close to him in the clearing so that he had seen the great tusks but he did not know that nothing would ever be as good as that again now he knew they would kill the elephant and there was nothing he could do about it he had betrayed the elephant when he had gone back to tell them at the shamba they would kill me and they would kill kibo if we had ivory he had thought and known it was untrue probably the elephant is going to find where he was born and they ll kill him there that s all they d need to make it perfect they d like to have killed him where they killed his friend that would be a big joke that would have pleased them the goddamned friend killers they had moved to the edge of thick cover now and the elephant was close ahead david could smell him and they could all hear him pulling down branches and the snapping that they made his father put his hand on david s shoulder to move him back and have him wait outside and then he took a big pinch of ashes from the pouch in his pocket and tossed it in the air the ash barely slanted toward them as it fell and his father nodded at juma and bent down to follow him into the thick cover david watched their backs and their asses go in and out of sight he could not hear them move david had stood still and listened to the elephant feeding he could smell him as strongly as he had the night in the moonlight when he had worked up close to him and had seen his wonderful tusks then as he stood there it was silent and he could not smell the elephant then there had been a high squealing and smashing and a shot by the 303 then the heavy rocking double report of his father s 450 then the smashing and crashing had gone on going steadily away and he had gone into the heavy growth and found juma shaken and bleeding from his forehead all down over his face and his father white and angry he went for juma and knocked him over his father had said juma hit him in the head where did you hit him where i fucking well could his father had said get on the blood spoor there was plenty of blood one stream as high as david s head that had squirted bright on trunks and leaves and vines and another much lower that was dark and foul with stomach content lung and gut shot his father said we ll find him down or anchored i hope the hell he added they found him anchored in such suffering and despair that he could no longer move he had crashed through the heavy cover where he had been feeding and crossed a path of open forest and david and his father ran along the heavily splashed blood trail then the elephant had gone on into thick forest and david had seen him ahead standing gray and huge against the trunk of a tree david could only see his stern and then his father moved ahead and he followed and they came alongside the elephant as though he was a ship and david saw the blood coming from his flanks and running down his sides and then his father raised his rifle and fired and the elephant turned his head with the great tusks moving heavy and slow and looked at them and when his father fired the second barrel the elephant seemed to sway like a felled tree and came smashing down toward them but he was not dead he had been anchored and now he was down with his shoulder broken he did not move but his eye was alive and looked at david he had very long eyelashes and his eye was the most alive thing david had ever seen shoot him in the earhole with the three oh three his father said go on you shoot him david had said juma had come up limping and bloody the skin of his forehead hanging down over his left eye the bone of his nose showing and one ear torn and had taken the rifle from david without speaking and pushed the muzzle almost into the earhole and fired twice jerking the bolt and driving it forward angrily the eye of the elephant had opened wide on the first shot and then started to glaze and blood came out of the ear and ran in two bright streams down the wrinkled gray hide it was different colored blood and david had thought i must remember that and he had but it had never been of any use to him now all the dignity and majesty and all the beauty were gone from the elephant and he was a huge wrinkled pile well we got him davey thanks to you his father had said now we d better get a fire going so i can put juma back together again come here you bloody humpty dumpty those tusks will keep juma had come to him grinning bringing the tail of the elephant that had no hairs on it at all they had made a dirty joke and then his father had begun to speak rapidly in swahili how far to water how far will you have to go to get people to get those tusks out of here how are you you worthless old pig fucker what have you broken with the answers known his father had said you and i will go back to get the packs where we dropped them juma can get wood and have the fire ready the medical kit is in my pack we have to get the packs before it s dark he won t infect it s not like claw wounds let s go that evening as david had sat by the fire he had looked at juma with his stitched up face and his broken ribs and wondered if the elephant had recognized him when he had tried to kill him he hoped he had the elephant was his hero now as his father had been for a long time and he had thought i didn t believe he could do it when he was so old and tired he would have killed juma too but he didn t look at me as though he wanted to kill me he only looked sad the same way i felt he visited his old friend on the day he died david remembered how the elephant lost all dignity as soon as his eye had ceased to be alive and how when his father and he had returned with the packs the elephant had already started to swell even in the cool evening there was no more true elephant only the gray wrinkled swelling dead body and the huge mottled brown and yellow tusks that they had killed him for the tusks were stained with dried blood and he scraped some off with his thumbnail like a dried piece of sealing wax and put it in the pocket of his shirt that was all he took from the elephant except the beginning of the knowledge of loneliness after the butchery his father tried to talk to him that night by the fire he was a murderer you know davey he had said juma says nobody knows how many people he has killed they were all trying to kill him weren t they naturally his father had said with that pair of tusks how could he be a murderer then just as you like his father had said i m sorry you got so mixed up about him i wish he d killed juma david said i think that s carrying it a little far his father said juma s your friend you know not any more no need to tell him so he knows it david had said i think you misjudge him his father said and they had left it there then when they were finally back safely with the tusks after all the things that had happened and the tusks were propped against the wall of the stick and mud house leaning there with their points touching the tusks so tall and thick that no one could believe them even when they touched them and no one not even his father could reach to the top of the bend where they curved in for the points to meet there when juma and his father and he were heroes and kibo was a hero s dog and the men who had carried the tusks were heroes already slightly drunk heroes and to be drunker his father had said do you want to make peace davey all right he said because he knew this was the start of the never telling that he had decided on i m so glad his father said it s so much simpler and better then they sat on old men s stools under the shade of the fig tree with the tusks against the wall of the hut and drank beer from gourd cups that were brought by a young girl and her younger brother the servant of heroes sitting in the dust by the heroic dog of a hero who held an old cockerel newly promoted to the standing of the heroes favorite rooster they sat there and drank beer while the big drum started and the ngoma began to build part iii previously unpublished fiction a train trip represents the first four chapters of an unfinished and untitled lardneresque novel these scenes form a fine short story in the vein of the battler and fifty grand a train trip my father touched me and i was awake he stood by the bed in the dark i felt his hand on me and i was wide awake in my head and saw and felt things but all the rest of me was asleep jimmy he said are you awake yes get dressed then all right he stood there and i wanted to move but i was really still asleep get dressed jimmy all right i said but i lay there then the sleep was gone and i moved out of bed good boy my father said i stood on the rug and felt for my clothes at the foot of the bed they re on the chair my father said put on your shoes and stockings too he went out of the room it was cold and complicated getting dressed i had not worn shoes and stockings all summer and it was not pleasant putting them on my father came back in the room and sat on the bed do the shoes hurt they pinch if the shoe pinches put it on i m putting it on we ll get some other shoes he said it s not even a principle jimmy it s a proverb i see like two against one is nigger fun that s a proverb too i like that one better than about the shoe i said it s not so true he said that s why you like it the pleasanter proverbs aren t so true it was cold and i tied my other shoe and was finished dressing would you like button shoes my father asked i don t care you can have them if you like he said everybody ought to have button shoes if they like i m all ready where are we going we re going a long way where to canada we ll go there too he said we went out to the kitchen all the shutters were closed and there was a lamp on the table in the middle of the room was a suitcase a duffel bag and two rucksacks sit down at the table my father said he brought the frying pan and the coffee pot from the stove and sat down beside me and we ate ham and eggs and drank coffee with condensed cream in it eat all you can i m full eat that other egg he lifted the egg that was left in the pan with the pancake turner and put it on my plate the edges were crisped from the bacon fat i ate it and looked around the kitchen if i was going away i wanted to remember it and say good bye in the corner the stove was rusty and half the lid was broken off the hot water reservoir above the stove there was a wooden handled dish mop stuck in the edge of one of the rafters my father threw it at a bat one evening he left it there to remind him to get a new one and afterwards i think to remind him of the bat i caught the bat in the landing net and kept him in a box with screen over it for a while he had tiny eyes and tiny teeth and he kept himself folded in the box we let him loose down on the shore of the lake in the dark and he flew out over the lake flying very lightly and with flutters and flew down close over the water and then high and turned and flew over us and back into the trees in the dark there were two kitchen tables one that we ate on and one we did dishes on they were both covered with oilcloth there was a tin bucket for carrying lake water to fill the reservoir and a granite bucket for well water there was a roller towel on the pantry door and dish towels on a rack over the stove the broom was in the corner the wood box was half full and all the pans were hanging against the wall i looked all around the kitchen to remember it and i was awfully fond of it well said my father do you think you ll remember it i think so and what will you remember all the fun we ve had not just filling the wood box and hauling water that s not hard no he said that s not hard aren t you sorry to go away not if we re going to canada we won t stay there won t we stay there a while not very long where do we go then we ll see i don t care where we go i said try and keep that way my father said he lit a cigarette and offered me the package you don t smoke no that s good he said now you go outdoors and climb up on the ladder and put the bucket on the chimney and i ll lock up i went outside it was still dark but along the edge of the hills it was lightening the ladder was leaning against the roof and i found the old berry pail beside the woodshed and climbed the ladder the leather soles of my shoes felt insecure and slippery on the rungs i put the bucket over the top of the stove pipe to keep out the rain and to keep squirrels and chipmunks from climbing in from the roof i looked down through the trees to the lake looking down on the other side was the woodshed roof the fence and the hills it was lighter than when i started to climb the ladder and it was cold and very early in the morning i looked at the trees and the lake again to remember them and all around at the hills in back and the woods off on the other side of the house and down again at the woodshed roof and i loved them all very much the woodshed and the fence and the hills and the woods and i wished we were just going on a fishing trip and not going away i heard the door shut and my father put all the bags out on the ground then he locked the door i started down the ladder jimmy my father said yes how is it up there on the roof i m coming down go on up i m coming up a minute he said and climbed up very slowly and carefully he looked all around the way i had done i don t want to go either he said why do we have to go i don t know he said but we do we climbed down the ladder and my father put it in the woodshed we carried the things down to the dock the motor boat was tied beside the dock there was dew on the oilcloth cover the engine and the seats were wet with dew i took off the cover and wiped the seats dry with a piece of waste my father lifted down the bags from the dock and put them in the stem of the boat then i untied the bow line and the stern line and got back in the boat and held onto the dock my father primed the engine through a petcock rocking the wheel twice to suck the gasoline into the cylinder then he cranked the flywheel over and the engine started i held the boat to the dock with a twist of the line around a spile the propeller churned up the water and the boat pulled against the dock making the water swirl through the spiles let her go jimmy my father said and i cast off the line and we started away from the dock i saw the cottage through the trees with the windows shuttered we were going straight out from the dock and the dock became shorter and the shoreline opened out you take her my father said and i took the wheel and turned her out toward the point i looked back and saw the beach and the dock and the boat house and the clump of balm of gilead trees and then we were past the clearing and there was the cove with the mouth of the little stream coming into the lake and the bank high with hemlock trees and then the wooded shoreline of the point and then i had to watch for the sand bar that came way out beyond the point there was deep water right up to the edge of the bar and i went along the edge of the channel and then out around the end seeing the channel bank slope off underwater and the pickerel weed growing underwater and sucked toward us by the propeller and then we were past the point and when i looked back the dock and the boat house were out of sight and there was only the point with three crows walking on the sand and an old log half covered in the sand and ahead the open lake i heard the train and then saw it coming first in a long curve looking very small and hurried and cut into little connected sections moving with the hills and the hills moving with the trees behind it i saw a puff of white from the engine and heard the whistle then another puff and heard the whistle again it was still early in the morning and the train was on the other side of a tamarack swamp there was running water on each side of the tracks clear spring water with a brown swamp bottom and there was a mist over the center of the swamp the trees that had been killed in the forest fires were grey and thin and dead in the mist but the mist was not foggy it was cold and white and early morning the train was coming straight down the tracks now getting closer and closer and bigger and bigger i stepped back from the tracks and looked back at the lake with the two grocery stores and the boat houses the long docks going out into the water and close by the station the gravelled patch around the artesian well where the water came straight up in the sunlight out of a brown water film covered pipe the water was splashing in the fountain basin in back was the lake with a breeze coming up there were woods along the shore and the boat we had come in was tied to the dock the train stopped the conductor and the brakeman got down and my father said good bye to fred cuthbert who was going to take care of the boat in his boat house when will you be back i don t know fred my father said give her a coat of paint in the spring good bye jimmy fred said take good care of yourself good bye fred we shook hands with fred and got on the train the conductor got on in the car ahead and the brakeman picked up the little box we had stepped up on and swung aboard the train as it started fred stood there on the station platform and i watched the station fred standing there then walking away the water splashing up out of the pipe in the sun and then ties and the swamp and the station very small and the lake looking different and from a new angle and then we were out of sight and crossed the bear river and went through a cut and there were only the ties and the rails running back and fireweed growing beside the track and nothing more to look at to remember it was all new now looking out from the platform and the woods had that new look of woods you do not know and if you passed a lake it was the same way it was just a lake and new and not like a lake you had lived on you ll get all cinders out here my father said i guess we d better go in i said i felt funny with so much new country i suppose it really looked just the same as the country where we lived but it did not feel the same i suppose every patch of hardwood with the leaves turning looks alike but when you see a beech woods from the train it does not make you happy it only makes you want the woods where you live but i did not know that then i thought it would all be like where we lived only more of it and that it would be just the same and give you the same feeling but it didn t we did not have anything to do with it the hills were worse than the woods perhaps all the hills in michigan look the same but up in the car i looked out of the window and i would see woods and swamps and we would cross a stream and it was very interesting and then we would pass hills with a farmhouse and the woods behind them and they were the same hills but they were different and everything was a little different i suppose of course that hills that a railroad runs by can not be the same but it was not the way i had thought it was going to be but it was a fine day early in the fall the air was fine with the window open and in a little while i was hungry we had been up since before it was light and now it was almost half past eight my father came back down the car to our seat how do you feel jimmy hungry he gave me a bar of chocolate and an apple out of his pocket come on up to the smoker he said and i followed him through the car and into the next one ahead we sat down in a seat my father inside next to the window it was dirty in the smoker and the black leather on the seats had been burned by cinders look at the seats opposite us my father said to me without looking toward them opposite us two men sat side by side the man on the inside was looking out the window and his right wrist was handcuffed to the left wrist of the man who sat beside him in the seat ahead of them were two other men i could only see their backs but they sat the same way the two men who sat on the aisle were talking in a day coach the man opposite us said the man who sat in front of him spoke without turning around well why didn t we take the night train did you want to sleep with these sure why not it s more comfortable this way the hell it s comfortable the man who was looking out of the window looked at us and winked he was a little man and he wore a cap there was a bandage around his head under the cap the man he was handcuffed to wore a cap also but his neck was thick he was dressed in a blue suit and he wore a cap as though it was only for travelling the two men on the next seat were about the same size and build but the one on the aisle had the thicker neck how about something to smoke jack the man who had winked said to my father over the shoulder of the man he was handcuffed to the thick necked man turned and looked at my father and me the man who had winked smiled my father took out a package of cigarettes you want to give him a cigarette asked the guard my father reached the package across the aisle i ll give it to him said the guard he took the package in his free hand squeezed it put it in his handcuffed hand and holding it there took out a cigarette with his free hand and gave it to the man beside him the man next to the window smiled at us and the guard lit the cigarette for him you re awfully sweet to me he said to the guard the guard reached the package of cigarettes back across the aisle have one my father said no thanks i m chewing making a long trip chicago so are we it s a fine town the little man next to the window said i was there once i ll say you were the guard said i ll say you were we moved up and sat in the seat directly opposite them the guard in front looked around the man with him looked down at the floor what s the trouble asked my father these gentlemen are wanted for murder the man next to the window winked at me keep it clean he said we re all gentlemen here who was killed asked my father an italian said the guard who asked the little man very brightly an italian the guard repeated to my father who killed him asked the little man looking at the sergeant and opening his eyes wide you re pretty funny the guard said no sir the little man said i just asked you sergeant who killed this italian he killed this italian the prisoner on the front seat said looking toward the detective he killed this italian with his bow and arrow cut it out said the detective sergeant the little man said i did not kill this italian i would not kill an italian i do not know an italian write it down and use it against him the prisoner on the front seat said everything he says will be used against him he did not kill this italian sergeant asked the little man who did kill this italian you did said the detective sergeant said the little man that is a falsehood i did not kill this italian i refuse to repeat it i did not kill this italian everything he says must be used against him said the other prisoner sergeant why did you kill this italian it was an error sergeant the little prisoner said it was a grave error you should never have killed this italian or that italian the other prisoner said shut to hell up the both of you said the sergeant they re dope heads he said to my father they re crazy as bed bugs bed bugs said the little man his voice rising there are no bed bugs on me sergeant he comes from a long line of english earls said the other prisoner ask the senator there he nodded at my father ask the little man there said the first prisoner he s just george washington s age he cannot tell a lie speak up boy the big prisoner stared at me cut it out the guard said yes sergeant said the little prisoner make him cut it out he s got no right to bring in the little lad i was a boy myself once the big prisoner said shut your goddam mouth the guard said that s right sergeant began the little prisoner shut your goddam mouth the little prisoner winked at me maybe we better go back to the other car my father said to me see you later he said to the two detectives sure see you at lunch the other detective nodded the little prisoner winked at us he watched us go down the aisle the other prisoner was looking out of the window we walked back through the smoker to our seats in the other car well jimmy what do you make of that i don t know neither do i said my father at lunch at cadillac we were sitting at the counter before they came in and they sat apart at a table it was a good lunch we ate chicken pot pie and i drank a glass of milk and ate a piece of blueberry pie with ice cream the lunch room was crowded looking out the open door you could see the train i sat on my stool at the lunch counter and watched the four of them eating together the two prisoners ate with their left hands and the detectives with their right hands when the detectives wanted to cut up their meat they used the fork in their left hand and that pulled the prisoner s right hand toward them both the hands that were fastened together were on the table i watched the little prisoner eating and he without seeming to do it purposefully made it very uncomfortable for the sergeant he would jerk without seeming to know it and he held his hand so the sergeant s left hand was always being pulled the other two ate as comfortably as they could they were not as interesting to watch anyway why don t you take them off while we eat the little man said to the sergeant the sergeant did not say anything he was reaching for his coffee and as he picked it up the little man jerked and he spilled it without looking toward the little man the sergeant jerked out with his arm and the steel cuffs yanked the little man s wrist and the sergeant s wrist hit the little man in the face son of a bitch the little man said his lip was cut and he sucked it who asked the sergeant not you said the little man not you with me chained to you certainly not the sergeant moved his wrist under the table and looked at the little man s face what do you say not a thing said the little man the sergeant looked at his face and then reached for his coffee again with his handcuffed hand the little man s right hand was pulled out across the table as the sergeant reached the sergeant lifted the coffee cup and as he raised it to drink it it jerked out of his hand and the coffee spilled all over everything the sergeant brought the handcuffs up into the little man s face twice without looking at him the little man s face was bloody and he sucked his lip and looked at the table you got enough yes said the little man i ve got plenty you feel quieter now very quiet said the little man how do you feel wipe your face off said the sergeant your mouth is bloody we saw them get on the train two at a time and we got on too and went to our seats the other detective not the one they called sergeant but the one handcuffed to the big prisoner had not taken any notice of what happened at the table he had watched it but he had not seemed to notice it the big prisoner had not said anything but had watched everything there were cinders in the plush of our seat in the train and my father brushed the seat with a newspaper the train started and i looked out the open window and tried to see cadillac but you could not see much only the lake and factories and a fine smooth road along near the tracks there were a lot of sawdust piles along the lake shore don t put your head out jimmy my father said i sat down there was nothing much to see anyway that is the town al moegast came from my father said oh i said did you see what happened at the table my father asked yes did you see everything i don t know what do you think the little one made that trouble for i guess he wanted to make it uncomfortable so they would take the handcuffs off did you see anything else i saw him get hit three times in the face where did you watch when he hit him i watched his face i watched the sergeant hit him well my father said while the sergeant hit him in the face with the handcuff on his right hand he picked up a steel bladed knife off the table with his left hand and put it in his pocket i didn t see no my father said every man has two hands jimmy at least to start with you ought to watch both of them if you re going to see things what did the other two do i asked my father laughed i didn t watch them he said we sat there in the train after lunch and i looked out of the window and watched the country it did not mean so much now because there was so much else going on and i had seen a lot of country but i did not want to suggest that we go up into the smoker until my father said to he was reading and i guess my restlessness disturbed him don t you ever read jimmy he asked me not much i said i don t have time what are you doing now waiting do you want to go up there yes do you think we ought to tell the sergeant no i said it s an ethical problem he said and shut the book do you want to tell him i asked no my father said besides a man is held to be innocent until the law has proved him guilty he may not have killed that italian are they dope fiends i don t know whether they use dope or not my father said many people use it but using cocaine or morphine or heroin doesn t make people talk the way they talked what does i don t know said my father what makes anyone talk the way they do let s go up there i said my father got the suitcase down opened it up and put the book in it and something out of his pocket he locked the suitcase and we went up to the smoker walking along the aisle of the smoker i saw the two detectives and the two prisoners sitting quietly we sat down opposite them the little man s cap was down over the bandage around his head and his lips were swollen he was awake and looking out of the window the sergeant was sleepy his eyes would shut and then open stay open a while and then shut his face looked very heavy and sleepy ahead on the next seat the other two were both sleepy the prisoner leaned toward the window side of the seat and the detective toward the aisle they were not comfortable that way and as they got sleepier they both leaned toward each other the little man looked at the sergeant and then across at us he did not seem to recognize us and looked all down the car he seemed to be looking at all the men in the smoker there were not very many passengers then he looked at the sergeant again my father had taken another book out of his pocket and was reading sergeant the little man said the sergeant held his eyes open and looked at the prisoner i got to go to the can the little man said not now the sergeant shut his eyes listen sergeant the little man said didn t you ever have to go to the can not now the sergeant said he did not want to leave the half asleep half awake state he was in he was breathing slowly and heavily but when he would open his eyes his breathing would stop the little man looked across at us but did not seem to recognize us sergeant he said the sergeant did not answer the little man ran his tongue over his lips listen sergeant i got to go to the can all right the sergeant said he stood up and the little man stood up and they walked down the aisle i looked at my father go on he said if you want to i walked after them down the aisle they were standing at the door i want to go in alone the prisoner said no you don t go on let me go in alone no why not you can keep the door locked i won t take them off go on sergeant let me go in alone we ll take a look the sergeant said they went inside and the sergeant shut the door i was sitting on the seat opposite the door to the toilet i looked down the aisle at my father inside i could hear them talking but not what they were saying someone turned the handle inside the door to open it and then i heard something fall against it and hit twice against the door then it fell on the floor then there was a noise as when you pick a rabbit up by the hind legs and slap its head against a stump to kill it i was looking at my father and motioning there was that noise three times and then i saw something come out from under the door it was blood and it came out very slowly and smoothly i ran down the aisle to my father there s blood coming out under the door sit down there my father said he stood up went across the aisle and touched the detective on the shoulder the detective looked up your partner went up to the washroom my father said sure said the detective why not my boy went up there and said he saw blood coming out from under the door the detective jumped up and jerked the other prisoner over on the seat the other prisoner looked at my father come on the detective said the prisoner sat there come on the detective said and the prisoner did not move come on or i ll blow your can off what s it all about your excellency the prisoner asked come on you bastard the detective said aw keep it clean the prisoner said they were going down the aisle the detective ahead holding a gun in his right hand and the prisoner handcuffed to him hanging back the passengers were standing up to see stay where you are my father said he took hold of me by the arm the detective saw the blood under the door he looked around at the prisoner the prisoner saw him looking and stood still no he said the detective holding his gun in his right hand jerked down hard with his left hand and the prisoner slipped forward on his knees no he said the detective watching the door and the prisoner shifted the revolver so he held it by the muzzle and hit the prisoner suddenly at the side of the head the prisoner slipped down with his head and hands on the floor no he said shaking his head on the floor no no no the detective hit him again and then again and he was quiet he lay on the floor on his face with his head bent down on his chest watching the door the detective laid the revolver down on the floor and leaning over unlocked the handcuff from the wrist of the prisoner then he picked up the revolver and stood up holding the revolver in his right hand he pulled the cord with his left to stop the train then he reached for the handle of the door the train was starting to slow get away from that door we heard someone say inside the door open it up said the detective and stepped back al the voice said al are you all right the detective stood just to one side of the door the train was slowing down al said the voice again answer me if you re all right there was no answer the train stopped the brakeman opened the door what the hell he said he looked at the man on the floor the blood and the detective holding the revolver the conductor was coming down from the other end of the car there s a fellow in there that s killed a man the detective said the hell there is he s gone out the window said the brakeman watch that man said the detective he opened the door to the platform i went across the aisle and looked out the window along the tracks there was a fence beyond the fence was the woods i looked up and down the tracks the detective came running by then ran back there was no one in sight the detective came back in the car and they opened the door of the washroom the door would not swing open because the sergeant was lying across it on the floor the window was open about halfway the sergeant was still breathing they picked him up and carried him out into the car and they picked up the prisoner and put him in a seat the detective put the handcuff through the handle of a big suitcase nobody seemed to know what to do or whether to look after the sergeant or try and find the little man or what everybody had gotten out of the train and looked down the tracks and in the edge of the woods the brakeman had seen the little man run across the tracks and into the woods the detective went into the woods a couple of times and then came out the prisoner had taken the sergeant s gun and nobody seemed to want to go very far into the woods after him finally they started the train to get to a station where they could send for the state constabulary and send out a description of the little man my father helped them with the sergeant he washed off the wound it was between the collarbone and the neck and sent me to get paper and towels from the washroom and folded them over and made a plug for it and tied it tight in with a sleeve from the sergeant s shirt they laid him out as comfortably as they could and my father washed off his face his head had been banged against the floor of the washroom and he was still unconscious but my father said the wound was not serious at the station they took him off and the detective took the other prisoner off too the other prisoner s face was white and he had a bruised bump on the side of his head he looked silly when they took him off and seemed anxious to move very fast to do whatever they told him my father came back in the car from helping them with the sergeant they had put him in a motor truck that was at the station and were going to drive him to a hospital the detective was sending wires we were standing on the platform and the train started and i saw the prisoner standing there leaning the back of his head against the wall of the station he was crying i felt pretty bad about everything and we went in the smoker the brakeman had a bucket and a bunch of waste and was mopping up and washing where the blood had been how was he doc he said to my father i m not a doctor my father said but i think he ll be all right two big dicks said the brakeman and they couldn t handle that one little shrimp did you see him get out the window sure said the brakeman or i saw him just after he lit on the tracks did you recognize him no not when i first saw him how do you think he stabbed him doc he must have jumped up on him from behind my father said wonder where he got the knife i don t know said my father that other poor boob said the brakeman he never even tried to make a break no that detective gave him his though did you see it doc yes that poor boob the brakeman said it was damp and clean where he had washed we went back to our seats in the other car my father sat and did not say anything and i wondered what he was thinking well jimmy he said after a while yes what do you think of it all now i don t know neither do i said my father do you feel bad yes so do i were you scared when i saw the blood i said and when he hit the prisoner that s healthy were you scared no my father said what was the blood like i thought a minute it was thick and smooth blood is thicker than water my father said that s the first proverb you run up against when you lead an active life it doesn t mean that i said it means about family no said my father it means just that but it always surprises you i remember the first time i found it out when was that i felt my shoes full of it it was very warm and thick it was just like water in your rubber boots when we go duck hunting except it was warm and thicker and smoother when was that oh a long time ago said my father the porter is a scene from the same unfinished and untitled novel as a train trip the porter when we went to bed my father said i might as well sleep in the lower berth because i would want to look out the window early in the morning he said an upper berth did not make any difference to him and he would come to bed after a while i undressed and put my clothes in the hammock and put on pajamas and got into bed i turned off the light and pulled up the window curtain but it was cold if i sat up to look out and lying down in bed i could not see anything my father took a suitcase out from under my berth opened it on the bed took out his pajamas and tossed them up to the upper berth then he took a book out and the bottle and filled his flask turn on the light i said no he said i don t need it are you sleepy jim i guess so get a good sleep he said and closed the suitcase and put it back under the berth did you put your shoes out no i said they were in the hammock and i got up to get them but he found them and put them out in the aisle he shut the curtain aren t you going to bed sir the porter asked him no my father said i m going to read a while up in the washroom yes sir the porter said it was fine lying between the sheets with the thick blanket pulled up and it all dark and the country dark outside there was a screen across the lower part of the window that was open and the air came in cold the green curtain was buttoned tight and the car swayed but felt very solid and was going fast and once in a while you would hear the whistle i went to sleep and when i woke up i looked out and we were going very slowly and crossing a big river there were lights shining on the water and the iron framework of a bridge going by the window and my father was getting into the upper berth are you awake jimmy yes where are we we re crossing into canada now he said but in the morning we ll be out of it i looked out of the window to see canada but all i could see were railway yards and freight cars we stopped and two men came by with torches and stopped and hit on the wheels with hammers i could not see anything but the men crouching over by the wheels and opposite us freight cars and i crawled down in bed again where are we in canada i asked windsor my father said good night jim when i woke up in the morning and looked out we were going through fine country that looked like michigan only with higher hills and the trees were all turning i got dressed in all but my shoes and reached under the curtain for them they were shined and i put them on and unbuttoned the curtain and went out in the aisle the curtains were buttoned all down the aisle and everybody seemed to be still asleep i went down to the washroom and looked in the nigger porter was asleep in one corner of the leather cushioned seat his cap was down over his eyes and his feet were up on one of the chairs his mouth was open his head was tipped back and his hands were together in his lap i went on to the end of the car and looked out but it was drafty and cindery and there was no place to sit down i went back to the washroom and went in very carefully so as not to wake the porter and sat down by the window the washroom smelt like brass spittoons in the early morning i was hungry and i looked out of the window at the fall country and watched the porter asleep it looked like good shooting country there was lots of brush on the hills and patches of woods and fine looking farms and good roads it was a different kind of looking country than michigan going through it it all seemed to be connected and in michigan one part of the country hasn t any connection with another there weren t any swamps either and none of it looked burnt over it all looked as though it belonged to somebody but it was nice looking country and the beeches and the maples were turned and there were lots of scrub oaks that had fine colored leaves too and when there was brush there was lots of sumac that was bright red it looked like good country for rabbits and i tried to see some game but it went by too fast to concentrate looking and the only birds you could see were birds flying i saw a hawk hunting over a field and his mate too i saw flickers flying in the edge of the woods and i figured they were going south i saw bluejays twice but the train was no good for seeing birds it slid the country all sideways if you looked straight at anything and you had to just let it go by looking ahead a little all the time we passed a farm with a long meadow and i saw a flock of killdeer plover feeding three of them flew up when the train went by and circled off over the woods but the rest kept on feeding we made a big curve so i could see the other cars curved ahead and the engine with the drive wheels going very fast away up ahead and a river valley down below us and then i looked around and the porter was awake and looking at me what do you see he said not much you certainly do look at it i did not say anything but i was glad he was awake he kept his feet up on the chair but reached up and put his cap straight that your father that stayed up here reading yes he certainly can drink liquor he s a great drinker he certainly is a great drinker that s it a great drinker i did not say anything i had a couple with him the porter said and i got plenty of effect but he sat there half the night and never showed a thing he never shows anything i said no sir but if he keeps up that way he s going to kill his whole insides i did not say anything you hungry boy yes i said i m very hungry we got a diner on now come on back and we ll get a little something we went back through two other cars all with the curtains closed all along the aisles to the diner and through the tables back to the kitchen hail fellow well met the porter said to the chef uncle george the chef said there were four other niggers sitting at a table playing cards how about some food for the young gentleman and myself no sir said the chef not until i can get it ready could you drink said george no sir said the chef here it is said george he took a pint

here said one of the niggers who was playing cards good bye gentlemen all george said good night sir said the chef we went out we went back up to our car and george looked at the number board there was a number twelve and a number five showing george pulled a little thing down and the numbers disappeared you better sit here and be comfortable he said i sat down in the washroom and waited and he went down the aisle in a little while he came back they re all happy now he said how do you like the railroad business jimmy how did you know my name that s what your father calls you ain t it sure well he said i like it fine i said do you and the chef always talk that way no james he said we only talk that way when we re enthused just when you have a drink i said not that alone when we re enthused from any cause the chef and i are kindred spirits what are kindred spirits gentlemen with the same outlook on life i did not say anything and the bell buzzed george went out pulled the little thing in the box and came back in the room did you ever see a man cut with a razor no would you like to have it explained yes the bell buzzed again i d better go see george went out he came back and sat down by me the use of the razor he said is an art not alone known to the barbering profession he looked at me don t you make them big eyes he said i m only lecturing i m not scared i should say you re not said george you re here with your greatest friend sure i said i figured he was pretty drunk your father got a lot of this he took out the bottle i don t know your father is a type of noble christian gentleman he took a drink i didn t say anything returning to the razor george said he reached in the inside pocket of his coat and brought out a razor he laid it closed on the palm of his left hand the palm was pink consider the razor george said it toils not neither does it spin he held it out on the palm of his hand it had a black bone handle he opened it up and held it in his right hand with the blade out straight you got a hair from your head how do you mean pull one out my own are very tenacious i pulled out a hair and george reached for it he held it in his left hand looking at it carefully then flicked the razor and cut it in two keenness of edge he said still looking at the little end of hair that was left he turned the razor in his hand and flicked the blade back the other direction the blade cut the hair off close to his finger and thumb simplicity of action george said two admirable qualities the buzzer rang and he folded the razor and handed it to me guard the razor he said and went out i looked at it and opened it and shut it it was just an ordinary razor george came back and sat down beside me he took a drink there was no more in the bottle he looked at it and put it back in his pocket the razor please he said i handed it to him he put it on the palm of his left hand you have observed he said keenness of edge and simplicity of action now a greater than these two security of manipulation he picked up the razor in his right hand gave it a little flip and the blade came open and lay back edge out across his knuckles he showed me his hand the handle of the razor was in his fist the blade was open across the knuckles held in place by his forefinger and his thumb the blade was solidly in place all across his fist the edge out you observe it george said now for that great requisite skill in the use of he stood up and patted out with his right hand his fist closed the blade open across the knuckles the razor blade shone in the sun coming through the window george ducked and jabbed three times with the blade he stepped back and flicked it twice in the air then holding his head down and his left arm around his neck he whipped his fist and the blade back and forth back and forth ducking and dodging he slashed one two three four five six he straightened up his face was sweaty and he folded the razor and put it in his pocket skill in the use of he said and in the left hand preferably a pillow he sat down and wiped his face he took off his cap and wiped the leather band inside he went over and took a drink of water the razor s a delusion he said the razor s no defense anybody can cut you with a razor if you re close enough to cut them they re bound to cut you if you could have a pillow in your left hand you d be all right but where you going to get a pillow when you need a razor who you going to cut in bed the razor s a delusion jimmy it s a nigger weapon a regular nigger weapon but now you know how they use it bending a razor back over the hand is the only progress the nigger ever made only nigger ever knew how to defend himself was jack johnson and they put him in leavenworth and what would i do to jack johnson with a razor it none of it makes any difference jimmy all you get in this life is a point of view fellows like me and the chef got a point of view even if he s got a wrong point of view he s better off a nigger gets delusions like old jack or marcus garvey and they put him in the pen look where my delusion about the razor would take me nothing s got any value jimmy liquor makes you feel like i ll feel in an hour you and me aren t even friends yes we are good old jimmy he said look at the deal they gave this poor old tiger flowers if he was white he d have made a million dollars who was he he was a fighter a damn good fighter what did they do to him they just took him down the road in one way or another all the time it s a shame i said jimmy there s nothing to the whole business you get syphed up from women or if you re married your wife ll run around in the railroad business you re away from home nights the kind of a girl you want is the kind of a girl that ll jig you because she can t help it you want her because she can t help it and you lose her because she can t help it and a man s only got so many orgasms to his whole life and what difference does it make when you feel worse after liquor don t you feel all right no i don t i feel bad if i didn t feel bad i wouldn t talk that way my father feels bad sometimes too in the morning he does sure what does he do for it he exercises well i got twenty four berths to make up maybe that s the solution it was a long day on the train after the rain started the rain made the windows of the train wet so you could not see outside clearly and then it made everything outside look the same anyway we went through many towns and cities but it was raining in all of them and when we crossed the hudson river at albany it was raining hard i stood out in the vestibule and george opened the door so i could see out but there was only the wet iron of the bridge and the rain coming down into the river and the train with water dripping it smelled good outside though it was a fall rain and the air coming in through the open door smelled fresh and like wet wood and iron and it felt like fall up at the lake there were plenty of other people in the car but none of them looked very interesting a nice looking woman asked me to sit down next to her and i did but she turned out to have a boy of her own just my age and was going to a place in new york to be superintendent of schools i wished i could have gone back with george to the kitchen of the dining car and heard him talk with the chef but during the regular daytime george talked just like anyone else except even less and very polite but i noticed him drinking lots of ice water it had stopped raining outside but there were big clouds over the mountains we were going along the river and the country was very beautiful and i had never seen anything like it before except in the illustrations of a book at mrs kenwood s where we used to go for sunday dinner up at the lake it was a big book and it was always on the parlor table and i would look at it while waiting for dinner the engravings were like this country now after the rain with the river and the mountains going up from it and the grey stone sometimes there would be a train across on the other side of the river the leaves on the trees were turned by the fall and sometimes you saw the river through the branches of the trees and it did not seem old and like the illustrations but instead it seemed like a place to live in and where you could fish and eat your lunch and watch the train go by but mostly it was dark and unreal and sad and strange and classical like the engravings that may have been because it was just after a rain and the sun had not come out when the wind blows the leaves off the trees they are cheerful and good to walk through and the trees are the same only they are without leaves but when the leaves fall from the rain they are dead and wet and flat to the ground and the trees are changed and wet and unfriendly it was very beautiful coming along the hudson but it was the son of thing i did not know about and it made me wish we were back at the lake it gave me the same feeling that the engravings in the book did and the feeling was confused with the room where i always looked at the book and it being someone else s house and before dinner and wet trees after the rain and the time in the north when the fall is over and it is wet and cold and the birds are gone and the woods are no more fun to walk in and it rains and you want to stay inside with a fire i do not suppose i thought of all those things because i have never thought much and never in words but it was the feeling of all those things that the country along the hudson river gave me the rain can make all places strange even places where you live black ass at the cross roads a completed short story was written between the end of world war ii and 1961 black ass at the cross roads we had reached the cross roads before noon and had shot a french civilian by mistake he had run across the field on our right beyond the farmhouse when he saw the first jeep come up claude had ordered him to halt and when he had kept on running across the field red shot him it was the first man he had killed that day and he was very pleased we had all thought he was a german who had stolen civilian clothes but he turned out to be french anyway his papers were french and they said he was from soissons sans doute c était un collabo claude said he ran didn t he red asked claude told him to halt in good french put him in the game book as a collabo i said put his papers back on him what was he doing up here if he comes from soissons red asked soissons s way the hell back he fled ahead of our troops because he was a collaborator claude explained he s got a mean face red looked down at him you spoiled it a little i said listen claude put the papers back and leave the money someone else will take it you won t take it i said there will be plenty of money coming through on krauts then i told them where to put the two vehicles and where to set up shop and sent onèsime across the field to cross the two roads and get into the shuttered estaminet and find out what had gone through on the escape route road quite a little had gone through always on the road to the right i knew plenty more had to come through and i paced the distances back from the road to the two traps we had set up we were using kraut weapons so the noise would not alarm them if anyone heard the noise coming up on the cross roads we set the traps well beyond the cross roads so that we would not louse up the cross roads and make it look like a shambles we wanted them to hit the cross roads fast and keep coming it is a beautiful guet apens claude said and red asked me what was that i told him it was only a trap as always red said he must remember the word he now spoke his idea of french about half the time and if given an order perhaps half the time he would answer in what he thought was french it was comic and i liked it it was a beautiful late summer day and there were very few more to come that summer we lay where we had set up and the two vehicles covered us from behind the manure pile it was a big rich manure pile and very solid and we lay in the grass behind the ditch and the grass smelled as all summers smell and the two trees made a shade over each trap perhaps i had set up too close but you cannot ever be too close if you have fire power and the stuff is going to come through fast one hundred yards is all right fifty yards is ideal we were closer than that of course in that kind of thing it always seems closer some people would disagree with this setup but we had to figure to get out and back and keep the road as clean looking as possible there was nothing much you could do about vehicles but other vehicles coming would normally assume they had been destroyed by aircraft on this day though there was no aircraft but nobody coming would know there had not been aircraft through here anybody making their run on an escape route sees things differently too mon capitaine red said to me if the point comes up they will not shoot the shit out of us when they hear these kraut weapons we have observation on the road where the point will come from the two vehicles they ll flag them off don t sweat i am not sweating red said i have shot a proved collaborator the only thing we have killed today and we will kill many krauts in this setup pas vrai onie onèsime said merde and just then we heard a car coming very fast i saw it come down the beech tree bordered road it was an overloaded grey green camouflaged volkswagen and it was filled with steel helmeted people looking as though they were racing to catch a train there were two aiming stones by the side of the road that i had taken from a wall by the farm and as the volkswagen crossed the notch of the cross roads and came toward us on the good straight escape road that crossed in front of us and led up a hill i said to red kill the driver at the first stone to onèsime i said traverse at body height the volkswagen driver had no control of his vehicle after red shot i could not see the expression on his face because of the helmet his hands relaxed they did not crisp tight nor hold on the wheel the machine gun started firing before the driver s hands relaxed and the car went into the ditch spilling the occupants in slow motion some were on the road and the second outfit gave them a small carefully hoarded burst one man rolled over and another started to crawl and while i watched claude shot them both i think i got that driver in the head red said don t be too fancy she throws a little high at this range red said i shot for the lowest part of him i could see bertrand i called over to the second outfit you and your people get them off the road please bring me all the feldbuchen and you hold the money for splitting get them off fast go on and help red get them into the ditch i watched the road to the west beyond the estaminet while the cleaning up was going on i never watched the cleaning up unless i had to take part in it myself watching the cleaning up is bad for you it is no worse for me than for anyone else but i was in command how many did you get onie all eight i think hit i mean at this range it s not very sporting but after all it s their machine gun we have to get set now fast again i don t think the vehicle is shot up badly we ll check her afterwards listen red said i listened then blew the whistle twice and everybody faded back red hauling the last kraut by one leg with his head shuddering and the trap was set again but nothing came and i was worried we were set up for a simple job of assassination astride an escape route we were not astride technically because we did not have enough people to set up on both sides of the road and we were not technically prepared to cope with armored vehicles but each trap had two german panzerfausten they were much more powerful and simpler than the general issue american bazooka having a bigger warhead and you could throw away the launching tube but lately many that we had found in the german retreat had been booby trapped and others had been sabotaged we used only those as fresh as anything in that market could be fresh and we always asked a german prisoner to fire off samples taken at random from the lot german prisoners who had been taken by irregulars were often as cooperative as head waiters or minor diplomats in general we regarded the germans as perverted boy scouts this is another way of saying they were splendid soldiers we were not splendid soldiers we were specialists in a dirty trade in french we said un métier très sale we knew from repeated questionings that all germans coming through on this escape route were making for aachen and i knew that all we killed now we would not have to fight in aachen nor behind the west wall this was simple i was pleased when anything was that simple the germans we saw coming now were on bicycles there were four of them and they were in a hurry too but they were very tired they were not cyclist troops they were just germans on stolen bicycles the leading rider saw the fresh blood on the road and then he turned his head and saw the vehicle and he put his weight hard down on his right pedal with his right boot and we opened on him and on the others a man shot off a bicycle is always a sad thing to see although not as sad as a horse shot with a man riding him nor a milk cow gut shot when she walks into a fire fight but there is something about a man shot off a bicycle at close range that is too intimate these were four men and four bicycles it was very intimate and you could hear the thin tragic noise the bicycles made when they went over onto the road and the heavy sound of men falling and the clatter of equipment get them off the road quick i said and hide the four vélos as i turned to watch the road one of the doors of the estaminet opened and two civilians wearing caps and working clothes came out each carrying two bottles they sauntered across the cross roads and turned to come up in the field behind the ambush they wore sweaters and old coats corduroy trousers and country boots keep them covered red i said they advanced steadily and then raised the bottles high above their heads one bottle in each hand as they came in for christ sake get down i called and they got down and came crawling through the grass with the bottles tucked under their arms nous sommes des copains one called in a deep voice rich with alcohol advance rum dumb copains and be recognized claude answered we are advancing what do you want out here in the rain onèsime called we bring the little presents why didn t you give the little presents when i was over there claude asked ah things have changed camarade for the better rudement the first rummy camarade said the other lying flat and handing us one of the bottles asked in a hurt tone on dit pas bonjour aux nouveaux camarades bonjour i said tu veux battre if it s necessary but we came to ask if we might have the vélos after the fight i said you ve made your military service naturally okay you take a german rifle each and two packs of ammo and go up the road two hundred yards on our right and kill any germans that get by us can t we stay with you we re specialists claude said do what the captain says get up there and pick out a good place and don t shoot back this way put on these arm bands claude said he had a pocket full of arm bands you re franctireurs he did not add the rest of it afterwards we can have the vélos one apiece if you don t have to fight two apiece if you fight what about the money claude asked they re using our guns let them keep the money they don t deserve it bring any money back and you ll get your share allez vite débine toi ceux sont des poivrots pourris claude said they had rummies in napoleon s time too it s probable it s certain i said you can take it easy on that we lay in the grass and it smelled of true summer and the flies the ordinary flies and the big blue flies started to come to the dead that were in the ditch and there were butterflies around the edges of the blood on the black surfaced road there were yellow butterflies and white butterflies around the blood and the streaks where the bodies had been hauled i didn t know butterflies ate blood red said i didn t either of course when we hunt it s too cold for butterflies when we hunt in wyoming the picket pin gophers and the prairie dogs are holed up already that s the fifteenth of september i m going to watch and see if they really eat it red said want to take my glasses he watched and after a while he said i ll be damned if i can tell but it sure interests them then he turned to onèsime and said piss pauvre krauts onie pas de pistol pas de binoculaire fuck all rien assez de sous onèsime said we re doing all right on the money no fucking place to spend it some day je veux spend maintenant red said claude opened one of the two bottles with the cork screw on his boy scout german knife he smelled it and handed it to me c est du gnôle the other outfit had been working on their share they were our best friends but as soon as we were split they seemed like the others and the vehicles seemed like the rear echelon you split too easy i thought you want to watch that that s one more thing you can watch i took a drink from the bottle it was very strong raw spirits and all it had was fire i handed it back to claude who gave it to red tears came into his eyes when he swallowed it what do they make it out of up here onie potatoes i think and parings from horses hooves they get at the blacksmith shop i translated to red i taste everything but the potatoes he said they age it in rusty nail kegs with a few old nails to give it zest i better take another to take the taste out of my mouth red said mon capitaine should we die together bonjour toute le monde i said this was an old joke we had about an algerian who was about to be guillotined on the pavement outside the santé who replied with that phrase when asked if he had any last words to say to the butterflies onèsime drank to the nail kegs claude raised the bottle listen red said and handed the bottle to me we all heard the noise of a tracked vehicle the fucking jackpot red said along ongfong de la patree le fucking jackpot ou le more he sang softly the nail keg juice no good to him now i took another good drink of the juice as we lay and checked everything and looked up the road to our left then it came in sight it was a kraut halftrack and it was crowded to standing room only when you set a trap on an escape route you have four or if you can afford them five teller mines armed on the far side of the road they lie like round checker counters wider than the biggest soup plates and toad squatted in their thick deadliness they are in a semi circle covered with cut grass and connected by a heavy tarred line which may be procured at any ship chandler s one end of this line is made fast to a kilometer marking called a borne or to a tenth of a kilometer stone or any other completely solid object and the line runs loosely across the road and is coiled in the first or second section of the trap the approaching overloaded vehicle was of the type where the driver looks out through slits and its heavy machine guns now showed high in anti aircraft position we were all watching it closely as it came nearer so very overcrowded it was full of combat s s and we could see the collars now and faces were clear then clearer pull the cord i called to the second outfit and as the cord took up its slack and commenced to tighten the mines moved out of their semi circle and across the road looking i thought like nothing but green grass covered teller mines now the driver would see them and stop or he would go on and hit them you should not attack an armored vehicle while it was moving but if he braked i could hit him with the big headed german bazooka the half track came on very fast and now we could see the faces quite clearly they were all looking down the road where the point would come from claude and onie were white and red had a twitch in the muscle of his cheek i felt hollow as always then someone in the half track saw the blood and the volkswagen in the ditch and the bodies they were shouting in german and the driver and the officer with him must have seen the mines across the road and they came to a tearing swerving halt and had started to back when the bazooka hit it hit while both outfits were firing from the two traps the people in the half track had mines themselves and were hurrying to set up their own road block to cover what had gone through because when the kraut bazooka hit and the vehicle went up we all dropped our heads and everything rained down as from a fountain it rained metal and other things i checked on claude and onie and red and they were all firing i was firing too with a smeizer on the slits and my back was wet and i had stuff all over my neck but i had seen what fountained up i could not understand why the vehicle had not been blown wide open or overturned but it just blew straight up the fifties from the vehicle were firing and there was so much noise you could not hear no one showed from the half track and i thought it was over and was going to wave the fifties off when someone inside threw a stick grenade that exploded just beyond the edge of the road they re killing their dead claude said can i go up and put a couple into her i can hit her again no once was enough my whole back s tattooed okay go on he crawled forward snaking in the grass under the fire of the fifties and pulled the pin from a grenade and let the lever snap loose and held the grenade smoking grey and then lobbed it underhand up over the side of the half track it exploded with a jumping roar and you could hear the fragments whang against the armor come on out claude said in german a german machine gun pistol started shooting from the right hand slit red hit the slit twice the pistol fired again it was obvious it was not being aimed come on out claude called the pistol shot again making a noise like children rattling a stick along a picket fence i shot back making the same silly noise come on back claude i said you fire on one slit red onie you fire on the other when claude came back fast i said fuck that kraut we ll use up another one we can get more the point will be up anyway this is their rear guard onie said this vehicle go ahead and shoot it i said to claude he shot it and there was no front compartment and then they went in after what would be left of the money and the paybooks i had a drink and waved to the vehicles the men on the fifties were shaking their hands over their heads like fighters then i sat with my back against the tree to think and to look down the road they brought what paybooks there were and i put them in a canvas bag with the others not one of them was dry there was a great deal of money also wet and onie and claude and the other outfit cut off a lot of s s patches and they had what pistols were serviceable and some that weren t and put it all in the canvas sack with the red stripes around it i never touched the money that was their business and i thought it was bad luck to touch it anyway but there was plenty of prize money bertrand gave me an iron cross first class and i put it in the pocket of my shirt we kept some for a while and then we gave them all away i never liked to keep anything it s bad luck in the end i had stuff for a while that i wished i could have sent back afterwards or to their families the outfit looked as though they had been showered by chunks and particles from an explosion in an abattoir and the other people did not look too clean when they came out from the body of the halftrack i did not know how badly i must have looked myself until i noticed how many flies there were around my back and neck and shoulders the half track lay across the road and any vehicle passing would have to slow down everyone was rich now and we had lost no one and the place was ruined we would have to fight on another day and i was sure this was the rear guard and all we would get now would be strays and unfortunates disarm the mines and pick up everything and we will go back to the farmhouse and clean up we can interdict the road from there like in the book they came in heavily loaded and everyone was very cheerful we left the vehicles where they were and washed up at the pump in the farmyard and red put iodine on the metal cuts and scratches and sifted sulfa on onie and claude and me and then claude took care of red haven t they got anything to drink in that farmhouse i asked rené i don t know we ve been too busy get in and see he found some bottles of red wine that was drinkable and i sat around and checked the weapons and made jokes we had very severe discipline but no formality except when we were back at division or when we wanted to show off encore un coup manqué i said that was a very old joke and it was a phrase that a crook we had with us for a while always uttered when i would let something worthless go by to wait for something good it s terrible said claude it s intolerable said michel me i can go no further onèsime said moi je suis la france red said you fight claude asked him pas moi red answered i command you fight claude asked me jamais why is your shirt covered with blood i was attending the birth of a calf are you a midwife or a veterinary i give only the name rank and serial number we drank some more wine and watched the road and waited for the point to come up où est la fucking point red asked i am not in their confidence i m glad it didn t come up while we had the little accrochage onie said tell me mon capitaine how did you feel when you let the thing go very hollow what did you think about i hoped to christ it would not trickle out we were certainly lucky they were loaded with stuff or that they didn t back up and deploy don t ruin my afternoon marcel said two krauts on bicycles red said approaching from the west plucky chaps i said encore un coup manqué said onie anybody want them nobody wanted them they were pedaling steadily slumped forward and their boots were too big for the pedals i ll try one with the m 1 i said auguste handed it to me and i waited until the first german on the bicycle was past the half track and clear of the trees and then had the sight on him swung with him and missed pas bon said red and i tried it again swinging further ahead the german fell in the same disconcerting heartbreaking way and lay in the road with the vélo upside down and a wheel still spinning the other cyclist sprinted on and soon the copains were firing we heard the hard ta bung of their shots which had no effect on the cyclist who kept on pedaling until he was out of sight copains no bloody bon red said then we saw the copains falling back to retire onto the main body the french of the outfit were ashamed and sore on peut les fusiller claude asked no we don t shoot rummies encore un coup manqué said onie and everybody felt better but not too good the first copain who had a bottle in his shirt which showed when he stopped and presented arms said mon capitaine on a fait un véritable massacre shut up said onie and hand me your pieces but we were the right flank the copain said in his rich voice you re shit claude said you venerable alcoholic shut up and fuck off mais on a battu fought shit marcel said foute moi le camp on peut fusiller les copains red asked he had remembered it like a parrot you shut up too i said claude i promised them two vélos it s true claude said you and i will go down and give them the worst two and remove the kraut and the vélo you others keep the road cut it was not like this in the old days one of the copains said nothing s ever going to be like it was in the old days you were probably drunk in the old days anyway we went first to the german in the road he was not dead but was shot through both lungs we took him as gently as we could and laid him down as comfortable as we could and i took off his tunic and shirt and we sifted the wounds with sulfa and claude put a field dressing on him he had a nice face and he did not look more than seventeen he tried to talk but he couldn t he was trying to take it the way he d always heard you should claude got a couple of tunics from the dead and made a pillow for him then he stroked his head and held his hand and felt his pulse the boy was watching him all the time but he could not talk the boy never looked away from him and claude bent over and kissed him on the forehead carry that bicycle off the road i said to the copains cette putain guerre claude said this dirty whore of a war the boy did not know that it was me who had done it to him and so he had no special fear of me and i felt his pulse too and i knew why claude had done what he had done i should have kissed him myself if i was any good it was just one of those things that you omit to do and that stay with you i d like to stay with him for a little while claude said thank you very much i said i went over to where we had the four bicycles behind the trees and the copains were standing there like crows take this one and that one and foute moi le camp i took off their brassards and put them in my pocket but we fought that s worth two fuck off i said did you hear me fuck off they went away disappointed a boy about fourteen came out from the estaminet and asked for the new bicycle they took mine early this morning all right take it what about the other two run along and keep off the road until the column gets up here but you are the column no i said unfortunately we are not the column the boy mounted the bicycle which was undamaged and rode down to the estaminet i walked back under the hot summer sky to the farmyard to wait for the point i didn t know how i could feel any worse but you can all right i can promise you that will we go into the big town tonight red asked me sure they re taking it now coming in from the west can t you hear it sure you could hear it since noon is it a good town you ll see it as soon as the column gets up and we fit in and go down that road past the estaminet i showed him on the map you can see it in about a mile see the curve before you drop down are we going to fight any more not today you got another shirt it s worse than this it can t be worse than this one i ll wash this one out if you have to put it on wet it won t hurt on a hot day like this you feeling bad yeah very what s holding claude up he s staying with the kid i shot until he dies was it a kid yeah oh shit red said after a while claude came back wheeling the two vélos he handed me the boy s feldbuch let me wash your shirt good too claude i got onie s and mine washed and they re nearly dry thanks very much red claude said is there any of the wine left we found some more and some sausage good claude said he had the black ass bad too we re going in the big town after the column overruns us you can see it only a little more than a mile from here red told him i ve seen it before claude said it s a good town we aren t going to fight any more today we ll fight tomorrow maybe we won t have to maybe cheer up shut up i m cheered up good red said take this bottle and the sausage and i ll wash the shirt in no time thank you very much claude said we were splitting it even between us and neither of us liked our share landscape with figures a story of the spanish civil war was written around 1938 and was one of the short stories hemingway suggested be included in a new collection he proposed in a letter to editor maxwell perkins on february 7 1939 landscape with figures it was very strange in that house the elevator of course no longer ran the steel column it slid up and down on was bent and there were several marble stairs in the six flights which were broken so that you had to walk carefully on the edges as you climbed so that you would not fall through there were doors which opened onto rooms where there were no longer any rooms and you could swing a perfectly sound looking door open and step across the door sill into space that floor and the next three floors below having been blasted out of the front of the apartment house by direct hits by high explosive shells yet the two top floors had four rooms on the front of the house which were intact and there was still running water in the back rooms on all of the floors we called this house the old homestead the front line had at the very worst moment been directly below this apartment house along the upper edge of the little plateau that the boulevard circled and the trench and the weather rotted sandbags were still there they were so close you could throw a broken tile or a piece of mortar from the smashed apartment house down into them as you stood on one of the balconies but now the line had been pushed down from the lip of the plateau across the river and up into the pine studded slope of the hill that rose behind the old royal hunting lodge that was called the caso del campo it was there that the fighting was going on now and we used the old homestead both as an observation post and as an advantage point to film from in those days it was very dangerous and always cold and we were always hungry and we joked a great deal each time a shell bursts in a building it makes a great cloud of brick and plaster dust and when this settles it coats the surface of a mirror so that it is as powdered as the windows which have been calcimined over in a new building there was a tall unbroken mirror in one of the rooms of that house giving off the stairs as you climbed and on its dusty surface i printed with my finger in large letters death to johnny and we then sent johnny the camera man into that room on some pretext when he opened the door during a shelling and saw that ghostly announcement staring at him from the glass he went into a white deadly dutch rage and it was quite a time before we were friends again then the next day when we were loading the equipment into a car in front of the hotel i got into the car and cranked up the glass of the side window as it was bitterly cold as the glass rose i saw printed on it with large red letters in what must have been a borrowed lipstick ed is a lice we used the car for several days with that mysterious to the spaniards slogan they must have taken it for the initials or slogan of some holland american revolutionary organization perhaps resembling the f a i or the c n t then there was the day when the great british authority on let us forget just what came to town he had a huge german type steel helmet which he wore on all expeditions in the direction of the front this was an item of clothing which none of the rest of us affected it was the general theory that since there were not many steel helmets these should be reserved for the shock troops and his wearing of this helmet formed in us an instant prejudice against the great authority we had met in the room of an american woman journalist who had a splendid electric heater the authority took an instant fancy to this very pleasant room and named it the club his proposal was that everyone should bring their own liquor there and be able to enjoy it in the warmth and pleasant atmosphere as the american girl was exceedingly hardworking and had been trying perhaps not too successfully to keep her room from becoming in any sense the club this definite baptism and classification came as rather a blow to her we were working there in the old homestead the next day shielding the camera lens as carefully as possible against the glare of the afternoon sun with a screen of broken matting when the authority arrived accompanied by the american girl he had heard us discussing the location at the club and had come to pay a visit i was using a pair of field glasses eight power small zeisses that you could cover with your two hands so that they gave no reflection and was observing from the shadow in the angle of the broken balcony the attack was about to start and we were waiting for the planes to come over and commence the bombardment which substituted for adequate artillery preparation due to the government s then shortage of heavy artillery we had worked in the house concealing ourselves as carefully as rats do because the success of our work and the possibility of continued observation depended altogether on not drawing any fire on the seemingly deserted building now into the room came the great authority and drawing up one of the empty chairs seated himself in the exact center of the open balcony steel helmet over sized binoculars and all the camera was at an angle on one side of the balcony window as carefully camouflaged as a machine gun i was in the angle of shadow on the other invisible to anyone on the hillside and always careful never to move across the sunny open space the authority was seated in plain sight in the middle of the sunny patch looking in his steel hat like the head of all the general staffs in the world his glasses blinking in the sun like a helio look i said to him we have to work here from where you re sitting your glasses make a blink that everybody on that hill can see ay dount think theys aneh dainjah een a house the authority said with calm and condescending dignity if you ever hunted mountain sheep i said you know they can see you as far as you can see them do you see how clearly you see the men with your glasses they have glasses too ay dount think theys aneh dainjah een a house the authority repeated wheah are the tanks there i said under the trees the two cameramen were making grimaces and shaking their clenched fists over their heads in fury i go to take the big camera into the back johnny said keep well back daughter i said to the american girl then to the authority they take you for somebody s staff you know they see that tin hat and those glasses and they think we re running the battle you re asking for it you know he repeated his refrain it was at that minute that the first one hit us it came with a noise like a bursted steam pipe combined with a ripping of canvas and with the burst and the roar and rattle of broken plaster and the dust smoke over us i had the girl out of the room and into the back of the apartment as i dove through the door something with a steel hat on passed me going for the stairs you may think a rabbit moves fast when it first jumps and starts zig zagging away but the authority moved through that smoke filled hall down those tricky stairs out the door and down the street faster than any rabbit one of the cameramen said he had no speed on the lens of his leica which would stop him in motion this of course is inaccurate but it gives the effect anyway they shelled the house fast for about a minute they came on such a flat trajectory you hardly had time to hold a breath between the rush and the jolt and roar of the burst then after the last one we waited a couple of minutes to see if it had stopped had a drink of water from the tap in the kitchen sink and found a new room to set up the camera the attack was just starting the american girl was very bitter against the authority he brought me here she said he said it was quite safe and he went away and did not even say good bye he cahnt be a gentleman i said look daughter watch now there it goes below us some men stood up half crouching and ran forward toward a stone house in a patch of trees the house was disappearing in the sudden fountainings of dust clouds from the shells that were registering on it the wind blew the dust clear after each shell so that the house kept showing plainly through the dust as a ship comes out of a fog and ahead of the men a tank lurched fast like a roundtopped gun snouted beetle and went out of sight in the trees as you watched the men who were running forward threw themselves flat then another tank went forward on the left and into the trees and you could see the flash of its firing and in the smoke that blew from the house one of the men who was on the gorund stood up and ran wildly back toward the trench that they had left when they attacked another got up and ran back holding his rifle in one hand his other hand on his head then they were running back from all along the line some fell as they ran others lay on the ground without ever having got up they were scattered all over the hillside what s happened the girl asked the attack has failed i said why it wasn t pushed home why wasn t it just as dangerous for them to run back as to go forward not quite the girl held the field glasses to her eyes then she put them down i can t see any more she said the tears were running down her cheeks and her face was working i had never seen her cry before and we had seen many things you could cry about if you were going to cry in a war everybody of all ranks including generals cries at some time or another this is true no matter what people tell you but it is to be avoided and is avoided and i had not seen this girl doing it before and that s an attack that s an attack i said now you ve seen one and what will happen they may send them again if there s enough people left to lead them i doubt if they will you can count the losses out there if you like are those men all dead no some are too badly wounded to move they will bring them in in the dark what will the tanks do now they ll go home if they re lucky but one of them was already unlucky in the pine woods a black dirty column of smoke began to rise and was then blown sideways by the wind soon it was a rolling black cloud and in the greasy black smoke you could see the red flames there was an explosion and a billowing of white smoke and then the black smoke rolled higher but from a wider base that s a tank i said burning we stood and watched through the glasses you could see two men get out of an angle of the trench and start up a slant of the hill carrying a stretcher they seemed to move slowly and ploddingly as you watched the man in front sank onto his knees and then sat down the man behind had dropped to the ground he crawled forward then with his arm under the first man s shoulder he started to crawl dragging him toward the trench then he stopped moving and you saw that he was lying flat on his face they both lay there not moving now they had stopped shelling the house and it was quiet now the big farmhouse and walled court showed clear and yellow against the green hillside that was scarred white with the dirt where the strong points had been fortified and the communication trenches dug there was smoke from small fires rising now over the hillside where men were cooking and up the slope toward the big farmhouse lay the casualties of the attack like many scattered bundles on the green slope the tank was burning black and greasy in the trees it s horrible the girl said it s the first time i ve ever seen it it s really horrible it always has been don t you hate it i hate it and i always have hated it but when you have to do it you ought to know how that was a frontal attack they are just murder are there other ways to attack oh sure lots of them but you have to have knowledge and discipline and trained squad and section leaders and most of all you ought to have surprise it makes now too dark to work johnny said putting the cap over his telephoto lens hello you old lice now we go home to the hotel today we work pretty good yes said the other one today we have got something very good it is too dom bad the attack is no good is better not to think about it sometime we film a successful attack only always with a successful attack it rains or snows i don t want to see any more ever the girl said i ve seen it now nothing would ever make me see it for curiosity or to make money writing about it those are men as we are look at them there on that hillside you are not men said johnny you are a womans don t make a confusion comes now the steel hat man said the other looking out of the window comes now with much dignity i wish i had bomb to throw to make suddenly a surprise we were packing up the cameras and equipment when the steel hatted authority came in hullo he said did you make some good pictures i have a car in one of the back streets to take you home elizabeth i m going home with edwin henry the girl said did the wind die down i asked him conversationally he let that go by and said to the girl you won t come no she said we are all going home together i ll see you at the club tonight he said to me very pleasantly you don t belong to the club any more i told him speaking as nearly english as i could we all started down the stairs together being very careful about the holes in the marble and walking over and around the new damage it seemed a very long stairway i picked up a brass nosecap flattened and plaster marked at the end and handed it to the girl called elizabeth i don t want it she said and at the doorway we all stopped and let the steel hatted man go on ahead alone he walked with great dignity across the part of the street where you were sometimes fired on and continued on with dignity in the shelter of the wall opposite then one at a time we sprinted across to the lee of the wall it is the third or fourth man to cross an open space who draws the fire you learn after you have been around a while and we were always pleased to be across that particular place so we walked up the street now protected by the wall four abreast carrying the cameras and stepping over the new iron fragments the freshly broken bricks and the blocks of stone and watching the dignity of the walk of the steel hatted man ahead who no longer belonged to the club i hate to write a dispatch i said it s not going to be an easy one to write this offensive is gone what s the matter with you boy asked johnny you must write what can be said the other one said gently certainly something can be said about a day so full of events when will they get the wounded back the girl asked she wore no hat and walked with a long loose stride and her hair which was a dusty yellow in the fading light hung over the collar of her short fur collared jacket it swung as she turned her head her face was white and she looked ill i told you as soon as it gets dark god make it get dark quick she said so that s war that s what i ve come here to see and write about were those two men killed who went out with the stretcher yes i said positively they moved so slowly the girl said pitifully sometime s it s very hard to make the legs move i said it s like walking in deep sand or in a dream ahead of us the man in the steel hat was still walking up the street there was a line of shattered houses on his left and the brick wall of the barracks on his right his car was parked at the end of the street where ours was also standing in the lee of a house let s take him back to the club the girl said i don t want anyone to be hurt tonight not their feelings nor anything heh she called wait for us we re coming he stopped and looked back the great heavy helmet looking ridiculous as he turned his head like the huge horns on some harmless beast he waited and we came up can i help you with any of that he asked no the car s just there ahead we re all going to the club the girl said she smiled at him would you come and bring a bottle of something that would be so nice he said what should i bring anything the girl said bring anything you like i have to do some work first make it seven thirtyish will you ride home with me he asked her i m afraid the other car is crowded with all that bit yes she said i d like to thank you they got in one car and we loaded all the stuff into the other what s the matter boy johnny said your girl go home with somebody else the attack upset her she feels very badly a woman who doesn t upset by an attack is no woman said johnny it was a very unsuccessful attack said the other fortunately she did not see it from too close we must never let her see one from close regardless of the danger it is too strong a thing from where she saw it is only a picture like old fashioned battle scene she has a kind heart said johnny different than you you old lice i have a kind heart i said and it s louse not lice lice is the plural i like lice better said johnny it sounds more determined but he put up his hand and rubbed out the words written in lipstick on the window we make a new joke tomorrow he said it s all right now about the writing on the mirror good i said i m glad you old lice said johnny and slapped me on the back louse is the word no lice i like much better is many times more determined go to hell good said johnny smiling happily now we are all good friends again in a war we must all be careful not to hurt each other s feelings i guess everything reminds you of something is a completed short story set in cuba where hemingway made his home at the finca vigía from 1939 to 1959 i guess everything reminds you of something it s a very good story the boy s father said do you know how good it is i didn t want her to send it to you papa what else have you written that s the only story truly i didn t want her to send it to you but when it won the prize she wants me to help you but if you can write that well you don t need anyone to help you all you need is to write how long did it take you to write that story not very long where did you learn about that type of gull in the bahamas i guess you never went to the dog rocks nor to elbow key there weren t any gulls nor terns nested at cat key nor bimini at key west you would only have seen least terns nesting killem peters sure they nest on the coral rocks right on the flats his father said where would you have known gulls like the one in the story maybe you told me about them papa it s a very fine story it reminds me of a story i read a long time ago i guess everything reminds you of something the boy said that summer the boy read books that his father found for him in the library and when he would come over to the main house for lunch if he had not been playing baseball or had not been down at the club shooting he would often say he had been writing show it to me when you want to or ask me about any trouble his father said write about something that you know i am the boy said i don t want to look over your shoulder or breathe down your neck his father said if you want though i can set you some simple problems about things we both know it would be good training i think i m going all right don t show it to me until you want to then how did you like far away and long ago i liked it very much the sort of problems i meant were we could go into the market together or to the cockfight and then each of us write down what we saw what it really was that you saw that stayed with you things like the handler opening the rooster s bill and blowing in his throat when the referee would let them pick up and handle them before pitting again the small things to see what we each saw the boy nodded and then looked down at his plate or we can go into the café and shake a few rounds of poker dice and you write what it was in the conversation that you heard not try to write everything only what you heard that meant anything i m afraid that i m not ready for that yet papa i think i d better go on the way i did in the story do that then i don t want to interfere or influence you those were just exercises i d have been glad to do them with you they re like five finger exercises those weren t especially good we can make better ones probably it s better for me to go on the way it was in the story sure his father said i could not write that well when i was his age his father thought i never knew anyone else that could either but i never knew anyone else that could shoot better at ten than this boy could not just show off shooting but shooting in competition with grown men and professionals he shot the same way in the field when he was twelve he shot as though he had built in radar he never took a shot out of range nor let a driven bird come too close and he shot with beautiful style and an absolute timing and precision on high pheasants and in pass shooting at ducks at live pigeons in competition when he walked out on the cement spun the wheel and walked to the metal plaque that marked the black stripe of his yardage the pros were silent and watching he was the only shooter that the crowd became dead silent for some of the pros smiled as though at a secret when he put his gun to his shoulder and looked back to see where the heel of the stock rested against his shoulder then his cheek went down against the comb his left hand was far forward his weight was forward on his left foot the muzzle of the gun rose and lowered then swept to left to right and back to center the heel of his right foot lifted gently as all of him leaned behind the two loads in the chambers ready he said in that low hoarse voice that did not belong to a small boy ready answered the trapper pull said the hoarse voice and from whichever of the five traps the grey racing pigeon came out and at whatever angle his wings drove him in full low flight above the green grass toward the white low fence the load of the first barrel swung into him and the load from the second barrel drove through the first as the bird collapsed in flight his head falling forward only the great shots saw the impact of the second load driving through onto the bird already dead in the air the boy would break his gun and walk back in off the cement toward the pavilion no expression on his face his eyes down never giving any recognition to applause and saying thanks in the strange hoarse voice if some pro said good bird stevie he would put his gun in the rack and wait to watch his father shoot and then the two of them would walk off together to the outdoor bar can i drink a coca cola papa better not drink more than half a one all right i m sorry i was so slow i shouldn t have let the bird get hard he was a strong low driver stevie nobody d ever have known it if i hadn t been slow you re doing all right i ll get my speed back don t worry papa just this little bit of coke won t slow me his next bird died in the air as the spring arm of the sunken trap swung him up from the opening in the hidden trench into driving flight everyone could see the second barrel hit him in the air before he hit the ground he had not gone a yard from the trap as the boy came in one of the local shooters said well you got an easy one stevie the boy nodded and put up his gun he looked at the scoreboard there were four other shooters before his father he went to find him you ve got your speed back his father said i heard the trap the boy said i don t want to throw you off papa you can hear all of them i know but now the number two trap is about twice as loud as any of the others they ought to grease it nobody s noticed it i don t think i always swing on the noise of the trap sure but if it s extra loud it s to your left left is loud his father did not draw a bird from the number two trap for the next three rounds when he did he did not hear the trap and killed the bird with his second barrel far out so that it just hit the fence to fall inside geez papa i m sorry the boy said they greased it i should have kept my damned mouth shut it was the night after the last big international shoot that they had ever shot in together that they had been talking and the boy had said i don t understand how anyone ever misses a pigeon don t ever say that to anybody else his father said no i mean it really there s no reason ever to miss one the one i lost on i hit twice but it fell dead outside that s how you lose i understand that that s how i lost but i don t see how any real shooter can miss one maybe you will in twenty years his father said i didn t mean to be rude papa that s all right his father said only don t say it to other people he was thinking of that when he wondered about the story and about the boy s writing with all his unbelievable talent the boy had not become the shooter he was on live birds by himself nor without being taught and disciplined he had forgotten now all about the training he had forgotten how when he started to miss live birds his father would take his shirt off him and show him the bruise on his arm where he had placed the gun incorrectly he had cured him of that by having him always look back at his shoulder to be sure he had mounted the gun before he called for a bird he had forgotten the discipline of weight on your forward foot keep your head down and swing how do you know your weight is on your forward foot by raising your right heel head down swing and speed now it doesn t matter what your score is i want you to take them as soon as they leave the trap never look at any part of the bird but the bill swing with their bills if you can t see the bill swing where it would be what i want from you now is speed the boy was a wonderful natural shot but he had worked with him to make him a perfect shot and each year when he would take him and start on his speed he would start killing a six or eight out of ten then move to nine out of ten hang there and then move up to a twenty out of twenty only to be beaten by the luck that separated perfect shooters in the end he never showed his father the second story it was not finished to his satisfaction at the end of vacation he said he wanted to get it absolutely right before he showed it as soon as he got it right he was going to send it to his father he had had a very good vacation he said one of the best and he was glad he had such good reading too and he thanked his father for not pushing him too hard on the writing because after all a vacation is a vacation and this had been a fine one maybe one of the very best and they certainly had had some wonderful times they certainly had it was seven years later that his father read the prize winning story again it was in a book that he found in checking through some books in the boy s old room as soon as he saw it he knew where the story had come from he remembered the long ago feeling of familiarity he turned through the pages and there it was unchanged and with the same title in a book of very good short stories by an irish writer the boy had copied it exactly from the book and used the original title in the last five of the seven years between the summer of the prize winning story and the day his father ran onto the book the boy had done everything hateful and stupid that he could his father thought but it was because he was sick his father had told himself his vileness came on from a sickness he was all right until then but that had all started a year or more after that last summer now he knew that boy had never been any good he had thought so often looking back on things and it was sad to know that shooting did not mean a thing great news from the mainland is another completed short story set in cuba great news from the mainland for three days it blew out of the south bending the fronds of the royal palms until they were parted in a line forward and away from the grey trunks that bent with the heavy wind as the wind increased the dark green stems of the fronds blew wildly as the wind killed them the branches of the mango trees shook and snapped in the wind and its heat burned the mango flowers until they were brown and dusty and their stems dried the grass dried and there was no more moisture in the soil and it was dust in the wind the wind blew day and night for five days and when it stopped half the palm fronds hung dead against the trunks the green mangos lay on the ground and on the trees and the blossoms were dead and the stems dry the mango crop was gone along with all the other things that went that year the call he had put in on the telephone came through from the mainland and the man said yes dr simpson and then heard the cracker voice say mr wheeler well sir that boy of yours certainly surprised us all today he really did we were giving him the usual sodium pentothal before the shock treatment and i ve always noticed that boy has an unusual resistance to sodium pentothal never took drugs did he not as far as i know no well naturally one never knows but he certainly put on a performance today threw five of us around just as though we were children five grown men i tell you had to postpone the treatment of course he has a morbid fear of electric shock that s completely unjustified and that s why i use the sodium pentothal but there was no question of administering it today now i regard it as an excellent sign he hasn t revolted against anything mr wheeler this is the most favorable sign i ve seen that boy s really making progress mr wheeler i was proud of him why i said to him stephen i didn t know you had it in you you can be proud and satisfied at the way he s getting along he wrote me one of the most interesting and significant letters right after the incident i m sending it over to you you didn t get the other letters that s right that s right there was a little delay in getting them off my secretary has been literally swamped you know how it is mr wheeler and i m a busy man well he used the vilest language of course when he was resisting the treatment but he apologized to me in the most gentlemanly way you should see that boy now mr wheeler he s taking care of his appearance now he s just the typical fashion plate of a young college gentleman what about the treatment oh he ll get the treatment i ll just have to double up on the quantity of the sodium pentothal first his resistance to that is simply amazing you understand these are extra treatments that he requested himself of course there might be something masochistic in that he even suggested that himself in his letter but i don t think so i think that boy s beginning to get a grasp of reality i m sending you the letter you can be very encouraged about that boy mr wheeler how s the weather over there what s that oh the weather well it s just a bit off from what i d describe as typical for this time of year no it s not entirely typical there has been some unreasonable weather to be frank you call up anytime mr wheeler i wouldn t be upset or worried about the progress that boy s making for a moment i ll send you his letter you could almost describe it as a brilliant letter yes mr wheeler no mr wheeler i d say everything s going finely mr wheeler there s nothing to worry about you d like to talk to him i ll see that your call goes through at the hospital tomorrow is better perhaps he s naturally a little exhausted after the treatment tomorrow would be better you say he didn t have the treatment that s quite correct mr wheeler i had no idea that boy was capable of anything like that strength that s correct the treatment is for tomorrow i ll just increase the sodium pentothal these additional treatments he requested himself remember give him a call day after tomorrow that s a free day for him and he will have had a rest that s right mr wheeler that s right you have no cause for anxiety i would say his progress could not be more satisfactory today s tuesday you call him on thursday any time thursday the wind was back in the south on thursday there was not much it could do now to trees except blow the dead brown palm branches and bum the few mango blossoms whose stems had not died but it yellowed the leaves of the alamo trees and blew dust and stripped leaves over the swimming pool it blew dust through the screens into the house and sifted it into the books and over the pictures the milk cows lay with their rumps against the wind and the cuds they chewed were gritty the winds always come in lent mr wheeler remembered that was the local name for them all bad winds had local names and bad writers always became literary about them he had resisted this as he had resisted writing that the palm branches blew forward making a line against the trunk as the hair of young women parts and blows forward when they stand with their backs to a storm he had resisted writing of the scent of the mango blooms when they had walked together on the night before the wind started and the noise of the bees in them outside his window there were no bees now and he refused to use the foreign word for this wind there had been too much bad literature made about the foreign names for winds and he knew too many of those names mr wheeler was writing in longhand because he did not wish to uncover the typewriter in the lenten wind the houseboy who had been a contemporary and a friend of his son when they were both growing up came in and said the call to stevie is ready hi papa stephen said in a hoarse voice i m fine papa really fine this is the time i ve really got this thing beat now you have no idea i ve really got a grasp of reality now dr simpson oh he s fine i really have confidence in him he s a good man papa i really have faith in him he s more down to earth than the majority of those people he s giving me a few extra treatments how s everybody good how s the weather good that s fine no difficulty about treatments no not at all everything s fine really glad everything s so good with you this time i ve really got the answer well we mustn t waste money on the telephone give my love to everyone good bye papa see you soon stevie sent you his best i said to the houseboy he smiled happily remembering the old days that s nice of him how is he fine i said he says everything is fine the strange country comprises four chapters of an uncompleted novel that hemingway worked on at intervals in 1946 1947 and 1950 1951 these scenes represent preliminary material for an early version of islands in the stream which was published posthumously in 1970 hemingway apparently discarded these chapters when he changed the direction of the novel as he worked on it readers will note the reuse of names subsequently given to other characters in the final version of islands in the stream none of these rearrangements diminishes the unity and integrity of the strange country the strange country miami was hot and muggy and the land

s wait she had been holding her hand on his thigh while he drove and now she took it away all right she said we ll wait they were driving west now on the broad coral gables road through the flat heat stricken outskirts of miami past stores filling stations and markets with cars with people going home from the city passing them steadily now they passed coral gables to their left with the buildings that looked out of the basso veneto rising from the florida prairie and ahead the road stretched straight and heatwelted across what had once been the everglades roger drove faster now and the movement of the car through the heavy air made the air cool as it came in through the scoop in the dash and the slanted glass of the ventilators she s a lovely car the girl said weren t we lucky to get her very we re pretty lucky don t you think so far you ve gotten awfully cautious on me not really but we can be jolly can t we i m jolly you don t sound awfully jolly well maybe then i m not couldn t you be though you see i really am i will be roger said i promise looking ahead at the road he had driven so many times in his life seeing it stretch ahead knowing it was the same road with the ditches on either side and the forest and the swamps knowing that only the car was different that only who was with him was different roger felt the old hollowness coming inside of him and knew he must stop it i love you daughter he said he did not think it was true but it sounded all right as he said it i love you very much and i m going to try to be very good to you and you re going to be jolly and i m going to be jolly that s wonderful she said have we started already we re on the road when will we see the birds they re much further in this time of year roger yes bratchen you don t have to be jolly if you don t feel like it we ll be jolly enough you feel however you feel and i ll be jolly for us both i can t help it today he saw on ahead where the road turned to the right and ran northwest through the forest swamp instead of west that was good that was really much better pretty soon they would come to the big osprey s nest in the dead cypress tree they had just passed the place where he had killed the rattlesnake that winter driving through here with david s mother before andrew was born that was the year they both bought seminole shirts at the trading post at everglades and wore them in the car he had given the big rattlesnake to some indians that had come in to trade and they were pleased with the snake because he had a fine hide and twelve rattles and roger remembered how heavy and thick he was when he lifted him with his huge flattened head hanging and how the indian smiled when he took him that was the year they shot the wild turkey as he crossed the road that early morning coming out of the mist that was just thinning with the first sun the cypresses showing black in the silver mist and the turkey brown bronze and lovely as he stepped onto the road stepping high headed then crouching to run then flopping on the road i m fine he told the girl we get into some nice country now where do you think we ll get to tonight we ll find some place once we get to the gulf side this breeze will be a sea breeze instead of a land breeze and it will be cool that will be lovely the girl said i hated to think of staying the first night in that hotel we were awfully lucky to get away i didn t think we could do it that quickly i wonder how tom is lonely roger said isn t he a wonderful guy he s my best friend and my conscience and my father and my brother and my banker he s like a saint only jolly i never knew anybody as fine she said it breaks your heart the way he loves you and the boys i wish he could have them all summer won t you miss them terribly i miss them all the time they had put the wild turkey in the back of the seat and he had been so heavy warm and beautiful with the shining bronze plumage so different from the blues and blacks of a domestic turkey and david s mother was so excited she could hardly speak and then she had said no let me hold him i want to see him again we can put him away later and he had put a newspaper on her lap and she had tucked the bird s bloodied head under his wing folding the wing carefully over it and sat there stroking and smoothing his breast feathers while he roger drove finally she said he s cold now and had wrapped him in the paper and put him in the back of the seat again and said thank you for letting me keep him when i wanted him so much roger had kissed her while he drove and she had said oh roger we re so happy and we always will be won t we that was just around this next slanting turn the road makes up ahead the sun was down to the top of the treetops now but they had not seen the birds you won t miss them so much you won t be able to love me will you no truly i understand it making you sad but you were going to be away from them anyway weren t you sure please don t worry daughter i like it when you say daughter say it again it comes at the end of a sentence he said daughter maybe it s because i m younger she said i love the kids i love them all three hard and i think they re wonderful i didn t know there were kids like that but andy s too young for me to marry and i love you so i forget about them and just am as happy as i can be to be with you you re good i m not really i m awfully difficult but i do know when i love someone and i ve loved you ever since i can remember so i m going to try to be good you re being wonderful oh i can be much better than this don t try i m not going to for a while roger i m so happy we ll be happy won t we yes daughter and we can be happy for always can t we i know it sounds silly me being mother s daughter and you with everyone but i believe in it and it s possible i know it s possible i ve loved you all my life and if that s possible it s possible to be happy isn t it say it is anyway i think it is he d always said it was not in this car though in other cars in other countries but he had said it enough in this country too and he had believed it it would have been possible too everything was possible once it was possible on this road on that stretch that now lay ahead where the canal ran clear and flowing by the right hand side of the road where the indian poled his dugout there was no indian there now that was before when it was possible before the birds were gone that was the other year before the turkey that year before the big rattlesnake was the year they saw the indian poling the dugout and the buck in the bow of the dugout with his white throat and chest his slender legs with the delicate shaped hoofs shaped like a broken heart drawn up and his head with the beautiful miniature horns looking toward the indian they had stopped the car and spoken to the indian but he did not understand english and grinned and the small buck lay there dead with his eyes open looking straight at the indian it was possible then and for five years after but what was possible now nothing was possible now unless he himself was and he must say the things if there was ever to be a chance of them being true even if it were wrong to say them he must say them they never could be true unless he said them he had to say them and then perhaps he could feel them and then perhaps he could believe them and then perhaps they would be true perhaps is an ugly word he thought but it is even worse on the end of your cigar have you got cigarettes he asked the girl i don t know whether that lighter works i haven t tried it i haven t smoked i ve felt so unnervous you don t just smoke when you re nervous do you i think so mostly try the lighter all right who was the guy you married oh let s not talk about him no i just meant who was he no one you know don t you really want to tell me about him no roger no all right i m sorry she said he was english was is but i like was better besides you said was was is a good word he said it s a hell of a lot better word than perhaps all right i don t understand it at all but i believe you roger yes daughter do you feel any better much i m fine all right i ll tell you about him he turned out to be gay that was it he hadn t said anything about it and he didn t act that way at all not at all truly you probably think i m stupid but he didn t in any way he was absolutely beautiful you know how they can be and then i found out about it right away of course the same night actually now is it all right not to talk about it poor helena don t call me helena call me daughter my poor daughter my darling that s a nice word too you mustn t mix it with daughter though it s no good that way mummy knew him i thought she might have said something she just said she d never noticed and when i said you might have noticed she said i though you knew what you were doing and i had no call to interfere i said couldn t you just have said something or couldn t somebody just have said something and she said darling everyone thought you knew what you were doing everyone everyone knows you don t care anything about it yourself and i had every right to think you knew the facts of life in this right little tight little island she was sitting stiff and straight beside him now and she had no tone in her voice at all she didn t mimic she simply used the exact words or as exactly as she remembered them roger thought they sounded quite exact mummy was a great comfort she said she said a lot of things to me that day look roger said we ll throw it all away all of it we ll throw it all away now right here beside the road any of it you want to get rid of you can always tell me but we ve thrown it all away now and we ve really thrown it away i want it to be like that she said that s how i started out and you know i said at the start we d give it a miss i know i m sorry but i m glad really because now we have thrown it away it s nice of you but you don t have to make incantations or exorcisions or any of that i can swim without water wings and he was damned beautiful spit it out if that s the way you want it don t be like that you re so damned superior you don t have to be superior roger yes bratchen i love you very much and we don t have to do this any more do we no truly i m so glad now will we be jolly sure we will look he said there are the birds the first of them they showed white in the cypress hammock that rose like an island of trees out of the swamp on their left the sun shining on them in the dark foliage and as the sun lowered more came flying across the sky flying white and slow their long legs stretched behind them they re coming in for the night they ve been feeding out in the marsh watch the way they brake with their wings and the long legs slant forward to land will we see the ibises too there they are he had stopped the car and across the darkening swamp they could see the wood ibis crossing the sky with their pulsing flight to wheel and light in another island of trees they used to roost much closer maybe we will see them in the morning she said do you want me to make a drink while we ve stopped we can make it while we drive the mosquitoes will get to us here as he started the car there were a few mosquitoes in it the big black everglades type but the rush of the wind took them out when he opened the door and slapped them out with his hand and the girl found two enameled cups in the packages they had brought and the carton that held a bottle of white horse she wiped the cups out with a paper napkin poured in scotch the bottle still in the carton put in lumps of ice from the thermos jug and poured soda into them here s to us she said and gave him the cold enameled cup and he held it drinking slowly and driving on holding the wheel with his left hand driving along into the road that was dusky now he put on the lights a little later and soon they cut far ahead into the dark and the two of them drank the whisky and it was what they needed and made them feel much better there is always a chance roger thought when a drink can still do what it is supposed to do this drink had done exactly what it should do it tastes sort of slimy and slippery in a cup enameled roger said that was pretty easy she said doesn t it taste wonderfully it s the first drink we ve had all day except that resin wine at lunch it s our good friend he said the old giant killer that s a nice name for it did you always call it that since the war that s when we first used it for that this forest would be a bad place for giants i think they ve been killed off a long time he said they probably hunted them out with those big swamp buggies with the huge tires that must be very elaborate it s easier with an enameled cup tin cups make it taste even better he said not for giant killing just for how good it can be but you ought to have ice cold spring water and the cup chilled in the spring and you look down in the spring and there are little plumes of sand that rise on the bottom where it s bubbling will we have that sure we ll have everything you can make a wonderful one with wild strawberries if you have a lemon you cut half of it and squeeze it into the cup and leave the rind in the cup then you crush the wild strawberries into the cup and wash the sawdust off a piece of ice from the icehouse and put it in and then fill the cup with scotch and then stir it till it s all mixed and cold don t you put in any water no the ice melts enough and there s enough juice in the strawberries and from the lemon do you think there will still be wild strawberries i m sure there will be do you think there will be enough to make a shortcake i m pretty sure there will be we better not talk about it i m getting awfully hungry we ll drive about another drink more he said and then we ought to be there they drove on in the night now with the swamp dark and high on both sides of the road and the good headlights lighting far ahead the drinks drove the past away the way the headlights cut through the dark and roger said daughter i ll take another if you want to make it when she had made it she said why don t you let me hold it and give it to you when you want it it doesn t bother me driving it doesn t bother me to hold it either doesn t it make you feel good better than anything not than anything but awfully good ahead now were the lights of a village where the trees were cleared away and roger turned onto a road that ran to the left and drove past a drugstore a general store a restaurant and along a deserted paved street that ran to the sea he turned right and drove on another paved street past vacant lots and scattered houses until they saw the lights of a filling station and a neon sign advertising cabins the main highway ran past there joining the sea road and the cabins were toward the sea they stopped the car at the filling station and roger asked the middle aged man who came out looking blue skinned in the light of the sign to check the oil and water and fill the tank how are the cabins roger asked o k cap the man said nice cabins clean cabins got clean sheets roger asked just as clean as you want them you folks fixing to stay all night if we stay all night s three dollars how s for the lady to have a look at one fine and dandy she won t ever see no finer mattresses sheets plumb clean shower perfect cross ventilation modern plumbing i ll go in the girl said here take a key you folks from miami that s right prefer the west coast myself the man said your oil s o k and so s your water the girl came back to the car the one i saw is a splendid cabin it s cool too breeze right off the gulf of mexico the man said going to blow all night all tomorrow probably part of thursday did you try that mattress everything looked marvelous my old woman keeps them so goddam clean it s a crime she wears herself to death on them i sent her up to the show tonight laundry s the biggest item but she does it there it is i just got nine into her he went to hang up the hose he s a little confusing helena whispered but it s quite nice and clean well you going to take her the man asked sure roger said we ll take her write in the book then roger wrote mr and mrs robert hutchins 9072 surfside drive miami beach and handed the book back any kin to the educator the man asked making a note of the license number in the book no i m sorry nothing to be sorry about the man said i never thought much of him just read about him in the papers like me to help you with anything no i ll just run her in and we ll put our things in that s three and nine gallons makes five fifty with the state tax where can we get something to eat roger asked two different places in town just about the same you prefer either one people speak pretty highly of the green lantern i think i ve heard of it the girl said somewhere you might widow woman runs it i believe that s the place the girl said sure you don t want me to help you no we re fine roger said just one thing i d like to say the man said mrs hutchins certainly is a fine looking woman thank you helena said i think that s lovely of you but i m afraid it s just that beautiful light no he said i mean it true from the heart i think we d better go in helena said to roger i don t want you to lose me so early in the trip inside the cabin there was a double bed a table covered with oilcloth two chairs and a light bulb that hung down from the ceiling there was a shower a toilet and a washbowl with a mirror clean towels hung on a rack by the washbowl and there was a pole at one end of the room with some hangers roger brought in the bags and helena put the ice jug the two cups and the cardboard canon with the scotch in it on the table with the paper bag full of white rock bottles don t look gloomy she said the bed is clean the sheets anyway roger put his arm around her and kissed her put the light out please roger reached up to the light bulb and turned the switch in the dark he kissed her brushing his lips against hers feeling them both fill without opening feeling her trembling as he held her holding her tight against him her head back now he heard the sea on the beach and felt the wind cool through the window he felt the silk of her hair over his arm and their bodies hard and taut and he dropped his hand on her breasts to feel them rise quick budding under his fingers oh roger she said please oh please don t talk is that him oh he s lovely don t talk he ll be good to me won t he and i ll try to be good to him but isn t he awfully big no oh i love you so and i love him so do you think we should try now so we ll know i can t stand it very much longer not knowing i haven t been able to stand it all afternoon we can try oh let s let s try let s try now kiss me once more in the dark he went into the strange country and it was very strange indeed hard to enter suddenly perilously difficult then blindingly happily safely encompassed free of all doubts all perils and all dreads held unholdingly to hold to hold increasingly unholdingly still to hold taking away all things before and all to come bringing the beginning of bright happiness in darkness closer closer closer now closer and ever closer to go on past all belief longer finer further finer higher and higher to drive toward happiness suddenly scaldingly achieved oh darling he said oh darling yes thank you my dear blessed i m dead she said don t thank me i m dead do you want no please i m dead let s no please believe me i don t know how to say it another way then later she said roger yes daughter are you sure yes daughter and you re not disappointed because of anything no daughter do you think you ll get to love me i love you he lied i love what we did he meant say it again i love you he lied again say it once more i love you he lied that s three times she said in the dark i ll try to make it come true the wind blew cool on them and the noise the palm leaves made was almost like rain and after a while the girl said it will be lovely tonight but do you know what i am now hungry aren t you a wonderful guesser i m hungry too they ate at the green lantern and the widow woman squirted flit under the table and brought them fresh mullet roe browned crisp and fried with good bacon they drank cold regal beer and ate a steak each with mashed potatoes the steak was thin from grass fed beef and not very good but they were hungry and the girl kicked her shoes off under the table and put both her bare feet on roger s she was beautiful and he loved to look at her and her feet felt very good on his does it do it to you she asked of course can i feel if the widow woman isn t looking it does it to me too she said aren t our bodies nice to each other they ate pineapple pie for dessert and each had another cold bottle of regal fresh from deep in the melting ice water of the cooler i have flit on my feet she said they ll be nicer when they don t have flit on them they re lovely with flit push really hard with them i don t want to push you out of the widow woman s chair all right that s enough you never felt any better did you no roger said truly we don t have to go to the movies do we not unless you want to very much let s go back to our house and then start out terribly early in the morning that s fine they paid the widow woman and took a couple of bottles of the cold regal in a paper sack and drove back to the cabins and put the car in the space between cabins the car knows about us already she said as they came in the cabin it s nice that way i was sort of shy with him at the start but now i feel like he s our partner he s a good car do you think the man was shocked no jealous isn t he awfully old to be jealous maybe maybe he s just pleased let s not think about him i haven t thought about him the car will protect us he s our good friend already did you see how friendly he was coming back from the widow woman s i saw the difference let s not even put the light on good roger said i ll take a shower or do you want one first no you then waiting in the bed he heard her in the bath splashing and then drying herself and then she came into the bed very fast and long and cool and wonderful feeling my lovely he said my true lovely are you glad to have me yes my darling and it s really all right it s wonderful we can do it all over the country and all over the world we re here now all right we re here here where we are here oh the good fine lovely here in the dark what a fine lovely wonderful here so lovely in the dark in the lovely dark please hear me here oh very gently here very gently please carefully please please very carefully thank you carefully oh in the lovely dark it was a strange country again but at the end he was not lonely and later waking it was still strange and no one spoke at all but it was their country now not his nor hers but theirs truly and they both knew it in the dark with the wind blowing cool through the cabin she said now you re happy and you love me now i m happy and i love you you don t have to repeat it it s true now i know it i was awfully slow wasn t i you were a little slow i m awfully glad that i love you see she said it isn t hard i really love you i thought maybe you would i mean i hoped you would i do he held her very close and tight i really love you do you hear me it was true too a thing which surprised him greatly especially when he found that it was still true in the morning they didn t leave the next morning helena was still sleeping when roger woke and he watched her sleeping her hair spread over the pillow swept up from her neck and swung to one side her lovely brown face the eyes and the lips closed looking even more beautiful than when she was awake he noticed her eyelids were pale in the tanned face and how the long lashes lay the sweetness of her lips quiet now like a child s asleep and how her breasts showed under the sheet she had pulled up over her in the night he thought he shouldn t wake her and he was afraid if he kissed her it might so he dressed and walked down into the village feeling hollow and hungry and happy smelling the early morning smells and hearing and seeing the birds and feeling and smelling the breeze that still blew in from the gulf of mexico down to the other restaurant a block beyond the green lantern it was really a lunch counter and he sat on a stool and ordered coffee with milk and a fried ham and egg sandwich on rye bread there was a midnight edition of the miami herald on the counter that some trucker had left and he read about the military rebellion in spain while he ate the sandwich and drank the coffee he felt the egg spurt in the rye bread as his teeth went through the bread the slice of dill pickle the egg and the ham and he smelled them all and the good early morning coffee smell as he lifted the cup they re having plenty of trouble over there aren t they the man behind the counter said to him he was an elderly man with his face tanned to the line of the sweatband of his hat and freckled dead white above that roger saw he had a thin mean cracker mouth and he wore steel rimmed glasses plenty roger agreed all those european countries are the same the man said trouble after trouble i ll take another cup of coffee roger said he would let this one cool while he read the paper when they get to the bottom of it they ll find the pope there the man drew the coffee and put the pot of milk by it roger looked up interestedly as he poured the milk into the cup three men at the bottom of everything the man told him the pope herben hoover and franklin delano roosevelt roger relaxed the man went on to explain the interlocking interests of these three and roger listened happily america was a wonderful place he thought imagine buying a copy of bouvard et pécuchet when you could get this free with your breakfast you are getting something else with the newspaper he thought but in the meantime there is this what about the jews he asked finally where do they come in the jews are a thing of the past the man behind the counter told him henry ford put them out of business when he published the protocols of the elders of zion do you think they re through not a doubt of it fella the man said you ve seen the last of them that surprises me roger said let me tell you something else the man leaned forward some day old henry will get the pope the same way he ll get him just like he got wall street did he get wall street oh boy the man said they re through henry must be going good henry you really said something then henry s the man of the ages what about hitler hitler s a man of his word what about the russians you ve asked the right man that question let the russian bear stay in his own backyard well that pretty well fixes things up roger got up things look good the man behind the counter said i m an optimist once old henry tackles the pope you ll see all three of them crumble what papers do you read any of them the man said but i don t get my political views there i think things out for myself what do i owe you forty five cents it was a first class breakfast come again the man said and picked up the paper from where roger had laid it on the counter he s going to figure some more things out for himself roger thought roger walked back to the tourist camp buying a later edition of the miami herald at the drugstore he also bought some razor blades a tube of mentholated shaving cream some dentyne chewing gum a bottle of listerine and an alarm clock when he arrived at the cabin and opened the door quietly and put his package on the table beside the thermos jug the enameled cups the brown paper bag full of white rock bottles and the two bottles of regal beer they had forgotten to drink helena was still asleep he sat in the chair and read the paper and watched her sleep the sun was high enough so that it did not shine on her face and the breeze came in the other window blowing across her as she slept without stirring roger read the paper trying to figure out from the various bulletins what had happened really and how it was going she might as well sleep he thought we better get whatever there is each day now and as much and as well as we can because it s started now it came quicker than i thought it would i do not have to go yet and we can have a while either it will be over right away and the government will put it down or there will be plenty of time if i had not had these two months with the kids i would have been over there for it i d rather have been with the kids he thought it s too late to go now it would probably be over before i would get there anyway there is going to be plenty of it from now on there is going to be plenty of it for us all the rest of our lives plenty of it too damned much of it i ve had a wonderful time this summer with tom and the kids and now i ve got this girl and i ll see how long my conscience holds out and when i have to go i ll go to it and not worry about it until then this is the start all right once it starts there isn t going to be any end to it i don t see any end until we destroy them there and here and everywhere i don t see any end to it ever he thought not for us anyway but maybe they will win this first one in a hurry he thought and i won t have to go to this one the thing had come that he had expected and known would come and that he had waited all one fall for in madrid and he was already making excuses not to go to it spending the time he had with the children had been a valid excuse and he knew nothing had been planned in spain until later but now it had come and what was he doing he was convincing himself there was no need for him to go it is liable all to be over before i can get there he thought there is going to be plenty of time there were other things that held him back too that he did not understand yet they were the weaknesses that developed alongside his strengths like the crevices in a glacier under its covering of snow or if that is too pompous a comparison like streaks of fat between muscles these weaknesses were a part of the strengths unless they grew to dominate them but they were mostly hidden and he did not understand them nor know their uses he did know though that this thing had come that he must go to and aid in every way he could and yet he found varied reasons why he did not have to go they were all varyingly honest and they were all weak except one he would have to make some money to support his children and their mothers and he would have to do some decent writing to make that money or he would not be able to live with himself i know six good stories he thought and i m going to write them that will get them done and i have to do them to make up for that whoring on the coast if i can really do four out of the six that will pretty well balance me with myself and make up for that job of whoring whoring hell it wasn t even whoring it was like being asked to produce a sample of semen in a test tube that could be used for artificial insemination you had an office to produce it in and a secretary to help you don t forget the hell with these sexual symbols what he meant was that he had taken money for writing something that was not the absolute best he could write absolute best hell it was crap goose crap now he had to atone for that and recover his respect by writing as well as he could and better than he ever had that sounded simple he thought try and do it some time but anyway if i do four as good as i can do and as straight as god could do them on one of his good days hi there deity wish me luck boy glad to hear you re doing so good yourself then i ll be straight with myself and if that six ply bastard nicholson can sell two out of the four that will stake the kids while we are gone we sure we don t you remember about we like the little pig we we we all the way home only away from home home that s a laugh there isn t any home sure there is this is home all this this cabin this car those once fresh sheets the green lantern and the widow woman and regal beer the drugstore and the breeze off the gulf that crazy at the lunch counter and a ham and egg sandwich on rye make it two to go one with a slice of raw onion fill her up and check the water and the oil please would you mind checking the tires please the hiss of compressed air administered courteously and free was home which was all oil stained cement everywhere all rubber worn on pavements comfort facilities and cokes in red vending machines the center line of highways was the boundary line of home you get to think like one of those vast spaces of america writers he said to himself better watch it better get a load of this look at your girl sleeping and know this home is going to be where people do not have enough to eat home is going to be wherever men are oppressed home is going to be wherever evil is strongest and can be fought home is going to be where you will go from now on but i don t have to go yet he thought he had some reasons to delay it no you don t have to go yet his conscience said and i can write the stories he said yes you must write the stories and they must be as good as you can write and better all right conscience he thought we have that all straightened out i guess the way things are shaping up i had better let her sleep you let her sleep his conscience said and you try very hard to take good care of her and not only that you take good care of her as good as i can he told his conscience and i ll write at least four good ones they better be good his conscience said they will be he said they ll be the very best so having promised and decided that did he then take a pencil and an old exercise book and sharpening the pencil start one of the stories there on the table while the girl slept he did not he poured an inch and a half of white horse into one of the enameled cups unscrewed the top of the ice jug and putting his hand in the cool depth pulled out a chunk of ice and put it in the cup he opened a bottle of white rock and poured some alongside of the ice and then swirled the lump of ice around with his finger before he drank they ve got spanish morocco sevilla pamplona burgos saragossa he thought we ve got barcelona madrid valencia and the basque country both frontiers are still open it doesn t look so bad it looks good i must get a good map though i ought to be able to get a good map in new orleans mobile maybe he figured it as well as he could without a map saragossa is bad he thought that cuts the railway to barcelona saragossa was a good anarchist town not like barcelona or lérida but still plenty there they can t have put up much of a fight maybe they haven t made their fight yet they d have to take saragossa right away if they could they would have to come up from catalonia and take it if they could keep the madrid valencia barcelona railway and open up madrid saragossabarcelona and hold irún it ought to be all right with stuff coming in from france they ought to be able to build up in the basque country and beat mola in the north that would be the toughest fight that son of a bitch he could not see the situation in the south except that the revolters would have to come up the valley of the tagus to attack madrid and they would probably try it from the north too would have to try it right away to try to force the passes of the quadarramas the way napoleon had done it i wish i had not been with the kids he thought i wish the hell i was there no you don t wish you hadn t been with the kids you can t go to everyone or you can t be at them the minute they start you re not a firehorse and you have as much obligation to the kids as to anything in the world until the time comes when you have to fight to keep the world so it will be o k for them to live in he corrected but that sounded pompous so he corrected it to when it is more necessary to fight than to be with them that was flat enough that would come soon enough figure this one out and what you have to do and then stick with that he told himself figure it as well as you can and then really do what you have to do all right he said and he went on figuring helena slept until eleven thirty and he had finished his second drink why didn t you wake me darling she said when she opened her eyes and rolled toward him and smiled you looked so lovely sleeping but we ve missed our early start and the early morning on the road we ll have it tomorrow morning give kiss kiss give hug a lug big hugalug feels better she said oh feels good when she came out from the shower with her hair tucked under a rubber cap she said darling you didn t have to drink because you were lonesome did you no just because i felt like it did you feel badly though no i felt wonderful i m so glad i m ashamed i just slept and slept we can swim before lunch i don t know she said i m so hungry do you think we could have lunch and then take a nap or read or something and then swim wunderbar we shouldn t start and drive this afternoon see how you feel daughter come here she said he did she put her arms around him and he felt her standing fresh and cool from the shower not dried yet and he kissed her slowly and happily feeling the happy ache come in him where she had pressed firm against him how s that that s fine good she said let s drive tomorrow the beach was white sand almost as fine as flour and it ran for miles they took a long walk along it in the late afternoon swimming out lying in the clear water floating and playing and then swimming in to walk further along the beach it s a lovelier beach than bimini even the girl said but the water s not as fine it doesn t have that quality the gulf stream water has no i guess not but after european beaches it s unbelievable the clean softness of the sand made walking a sensual pleasure that could be varied from the dry soft powdery to the just moist and yielding to the firm cool sand of the line of the receding tide i wish the boys were here to point out things and show me things and tell me about things i ll point out things you don t have to you just walk ahead a little way and let me look at your back and your can you walk ahead no you then she came up to him and said come on let s run side by side they jogged easily along the pleasant firm footing above the breaking waves she ran well almost too well for a girl and when roger forced the pace just a little she kept up easily he kept the same pace and then lengthened it a little again she kept even with him but said hi don t kill me and he stopped and kissed her she was hot from the running and she said no don t it s nice must go in the water first she said they dove into the surf that was sandy where it broke and swam out to the clean green water she stood up with just her head and shoulders out kiss now her lips were salty and her face was wet with the seawater and as he kissed her she turned her head so that her sea wet hair swung against his shoulder awfully salty but awfully good she said hold very hard he did here comes a big one she said a really big one now lift high up and we ll go over together in the wave the wave rolled them over and over holding tight onto each other his legs tight around hers better than drowning she said so much better let s do it once more they picked a huge wave this time and when it hung and curled to break roger threw them across the line of its breaking and when it crashed down it rolled them over and over like a piece of driftwood onto the sand let s get clean and lie on the sand she said and they swam and dove in the clean water and then lay side by side on the cool firm beach where the last inrush of the waves just touched their toes and ankles roger do you still love me yes daughter very much i love you you were nice to play i had fun we do have fun don t we it s been lovely all day we only had a half a day because i was a bad girl and slept so late that was a good sound thing to do i didn t do it to be good and sound i did it because i couldn t help it he lay alongside of her his right foot touching her left his leg touching hers and he put his hand on her head and neck old head s awfully wet you won t catch a cold in the wind i don t think so if we lived by the ocean all the time i d have to get my hair cut no it looks nice you d be surprised i love it the way it is it s wonderful short for swimming not for bed though i don t know she said you d still be able to tell i was a girl do you think so i m almost sure i could always remind you daughter what darling did you always like making love no do you now what do you think i think that if i had a good look both ways down the beach and there was no one in sight we d be all right it s an awfully lonely beach she said they walked back along the sea and the wind was still blowing and the rollers were breaking far out on the low tide it seems so awfully simple and as though there were no problems at all the girl said i found you and then all we ever had to do was eat and sleep and make love of course it s not like that at all let s keep it like that for a while i think we have a right to for a little while maybe not a right to but i think we can but won t you be awfully bored with me no he said he was not lonely after this last time as he had nearly always been no matter with whom or where he had not had the old death loneliness since the first time the night before you do something awfully good to me i m glad if i really do wouldn t it be awful if we were the kind of people who grated on each other s nerves and had to have fights to love each other we re not like that i ll try not to be but won t you be bored just with me no but you re thinking about something else now yes i was wondering if we could get a miami daily news that s the afternoon paper i just wanted to read about the spanish business the military revolt yes will you tell me about it sure he told her about it as well as he could within the limitations of his knowledge and his information are you worried about it yes but i haven t thought about it all afternoon we ll see what there is in the paper she said and tomorrow you can follow it on the radio in the car tomorrow we ll really get an early start i bought an alarm clock weren t you intelligent it s wonderful to have such an intelligent husband roger yes daughter what do you think they will have to eat at the green lantern the next day they started early in the morning before sunrise and by breakfast they had done a hundred miles and were away from the sea and the bays with their wooden docks and fish packing houses and up in the monotonous pine and scrub palmetto of the cattle country they ate at a lunch counter in a town in the middle of the florida prairie the lunch counter was on the shady side of the square and looked out on a red bricked court house with its green lawn i don t know how i ever held out for that second fifty the girl said looking at the menu we should have stopped at punta gorda roger said that would have been sensible we said we d do a hundred though the girl said and we did it what are you going to have darling i m going to have ham and eggs and coffee and a big slice of raw onion roger told the waitress how do you want the eggs straight up the lady i ll have corned beef hash browned with two poached eggs helena said tea coffee or milk milk please what kind of juice grapefruit please two grapefruits do you mind the onion roger asked i love onions she said not as much as i love you though and i never tried them for breakfast they re good roger said they get in there with the coffee and keep you from being lonely when you drive you re not lonely are you no daughter we made quite good time didn t we not really good that s not much of a stretch for time with the bridges and the towns look at the cowpunchers she said two men on cow ponies wearing western work clothes got down from their stock saddles and hitched their horses to the rail in front of the lunch room and walked down the sidewalk on their high heeled boots they run a lot of cattle around here roger said you have to watch for stock on all these roads i didn t know they raised many cattle in florida an awful lot good cattle now too don t you want to get a paper i d like to he said i ll see if the cashier has one at the drugstore the cashier said st petersburg and tampa papers at the drugstore where is it at the corner i doubt if you could miss it you want anything from the drugstore roger asked the girl camels she said remember we have to fill the ice jug i ll ask them roger came back with the morning papers and a carton of cigarettes it s not going so good he handed her one of the papers is there anything we didn t get on the radio not much but it doesn t look so good can they fill the ice jug i forgot to ask the waitress came with the two breakfasts and they both drank their cold grapefruit juice and started to eat roger kept on reading his paper so helena propped hers against a water glass and read too have you any chili sauce roger asked the waitress she was a thin juke joint looking blonde you bet she said you people from hollywood i ve been there ain t she from there she s going there oh jesus me the waitress said would you write in my book i d love to helena said but i m not in pictures you will be honey the waitress said wait a minute she said got a pen she handed helena the book it was quite new and had a grey imitation leather cover i only just got it she said i only had this job a week helena wrote helena hancock on the first page in the rather flamboyant untypical hand that had emerged form the mixed ways of writing she had been taught at various schools jesus beat me what a name the waitress said wouldn t you write something with it what s your name helena asked marie to marie from her friend helena wrote above the florid name in the slightly suspect script gee thanks marie said then to roger you don t mind writing do you no roger said i d like to what s your last name marie oh that don t matter he wrote best always to marie from roger hancock you her father the waitress asked yes said roger gee i m glad she s going out there with her father the waitress said well i certainly wish you people luck we need it roger said no the waitress said you don t need it but i wish it to you anyway say you must have got married awfully young i was roger said i sure as hell was he thought i ll bet her mother was beautiful she was the most beautiful girl you ever saw where s she now in london helena said you people certainly lead lives the waitress said do you want another glass of milk no thanks helena said where are you from marie fort meade the waitress said it s right up the road do you like it here this is a bigger town it s a step up i guess do you have any fun i always have fun when there s any time do you want anything more she asked roger no we have to roll they paid the check and shook hands thanks very much for the quarter the waitress said and for writing in my book i guess i ll be reading about you in the papers good luck miss hancock good luck helena said i hope you have a good summer it ll be all right the waitress said you be careful won t you you be careful too helena said o k marie said only it s kind of late for me she bit her lip and turned and went into the kitchen she was a nice girl helena said to roger as they got into the car i should have told her it was sort of late for me too but i guess that only would have worried her we must fill the ice jug roger said i ll take it in helena offered i haven t done anything for us all day let me get it no you read the paper and i ll get it have we enough scotch there s that whole other bottle in the carton that isn t opened that s splendid roger read the paper i might as well he thought i m going to drive all day it only cost a quarter the girl said when she came back with the jug but it s chipped awfully fine too fine i m afraid we can get some more this evening when they were out of the town and had settled down to the long black highway north through the prairie and the pines into the hills of the lake country the road striped black over the long varied peninsula heavy with the mounting summer heat now that they were away from the sea breeze but with them making their own breeze driving at a steady seventy on the straight long stretches and feeling the country being put behind them the girl said it s fun to drive fast isn t it it s like making your own youth how do you mean i don t know she said sort of foreshortening and telescoping the world the way youth does i never thought much about youth i know it she said but i did you didn t think about it because you never lost it if you never thought about it you couldn t lose it go on he said that doesn t follow it doesn t make good sense she said i ll get it straightened out though and then it will you don t mind me talking when it doesn t make completely good sense do you no daughter you see if i made really completely good sense i wouldn t be here she stopped yes i would it s super good sense not common sense like surrealism nothing like surrealism i hate surrealism i don t he said i liked it when it started it kept on such a long time after it was over was the trouble but things are never really successful until they are over say that again i mean they aren t successful in america until they are over and they have to have been over for years and years before they are successful in london where did you learn all this daughter i thought it out she said i ve had a lot of time to think while i was waiting around for you you didn t wait so very much oh yes i did you ll never know there was a choice to be made soon of two main highways with very little difference in their mileage and he did not know whether to take the one that he knew was a good road through pleasant country but that he had driven many times with andy and david s mother or the newly finished highway that might go through duller country that s no choice he thought we ll take the new one the hell with maybe starting something again like i had the other night coming across the tamiami trail they caught the news broadcast on the radio switching it off through the soap operas of the forenoon and on at each hour it isn t like fiddling while rome burns roger said it s driving west northwest at seventy miles an hour away from a fire that s burning up what you care about to the east and hearing about it while you drive away from it if we keep on driving long enough we ll get to it we hit a lot of water first roger do you have to go if you have to go you should no dammit i don t have to go not yet i figured that through yesterday morning while you were asleep didn t i sleep though it was shameful i m awfully glad you did do you think you got enough last night it was awfully early when i woke you i had a wonderful sleep roger what daughter we were mean to lie to that waitress she asked questions roger said it was simpler that way could you have been my father if i d begot you at fourteen i m glad you re not she said god it would be complicated it s complicated enough i suppose until i simplify it do you think i ll bore you because i m twenty two and sleep all night long and am hungry all the time and are the most beautiful girl i ve ever seen and wonderful and strange as hell in bed and always fun to talk to all right stop why am i strange in bed you are i said why i m not an anatomist he said i m just the guy that loves you don t you like to talk about it no do you no i m shy about it and very frightened always frightened my old bratchen we were lucky weren t we let s not even talk about how lucky do you think andy and dave and tom would mind no we ought to write to tom we will what do you suppose he s doing now roger looked through the wheel at the clock on the dashboard he will have finished painting and be having a drink why don t we have one fine she made the drinks in the cups putting in handfuls of the finely chipped ice the whisky and white rock the new highway was wide now and ran far and clear ahead through the forest of pines that were tapped and scored for turpentine it doesn t look like the landes does it roger said and lifting the cup felt the drink icy in his mouth it was very good but the chipped ice melted fast no in the landes there is yellow gorse in between the pines and they don t work the trees for turpentine with chain gangs either roger said this is all convict labor country through here tell me how they work it it s pretty damned awful he said the state contracts them out to the turpentine and lumber camps they used to catch everyone off the trains during the worst of the depression all the people riding the trains looking for work going east or west or south they d stop the trains right outside of tallahassee and round up the men and march them off to jail and then sentence them to chain gangs and contract them out to the turpentine and lumber outfits this is a wicked stretch of country it s old and wicked with lots of law and no justice pine country can be so friendly too this isn t friendly this is a bastard there are lots of lawless people in it but the work is done by the prisoners it s a slave country the law s only for outsiders i m glad we re going through it fast yes but we really ought to know it how it s run how it works who are the crooks and the tyrants and how to get rid of them i d love to do that you ought to buck florida politics some time and see what happens is it really bad you couldn t believe it do you know much about it a little he said i bucked it for a while with some good people but we didn t get anywhere we got the bejesus beat out of us on conversation wouldn t you like to be in politics no i want to be a writer that s what i want you to be the road was unrolling now through some scattered hardwood and then across cypress swamps and hammock country and then ahead there was an iron bridge across a clear dark watered stream beautiful and clear moving with live oaks along its bank and a sign at the bridge that said it was the senwannee sic river they were on it and over it and up the bank beyond and the road had turned north it was like a river in a dream helena said wasn t it wonderful so clear and so dark couldn t we go down it in a canoe some time i ve crossed it up above and it s beautiful wherever you cross it can t we make a trip on it sometime sure there s a place way up above where i ve seen it as clear as a trout stream wouldn t there be snakes i m pretty sure there d be a lot i m afraid of them really afraid of them but we could be careful couldn t we sure we ought to do it in the winter time there are such wonderful places for us to go she said i ll always remember this river now and we saw it only like the lens clicking in a camera we should have stopped do you want to go back not until we come to it going the other way i want to go on and on and on we re either going to have to stop to get something to eat or else get sandwiches and eat them while we drive let s have another drink she said and then get some sandwiches what kind do you think they ll have they ought to have hamburgers and maybe barbecue the second drink was like the first icy cold but quick melting in the wind and helena held the cup out of the rush of the air and handed it to him when he drank daughter are you drinking more than you usually do of course you didn t think i drank a couple of cups of whisky and water every noon by myself before lunch did you i don t want you to drink more than you should i won t but it s fun if i don t want one i won t take one i never knew about driving across the country and having our drinks on the way we could have fun stopping and poking around going down to the coast and seeing the old places but i want us to get out west so do i i ve never seen it we can always come back it s such a long way but this is so much more fun than flying this is flying roger will it be wonderful out west it always is to me isn t it lucky i ve never been out so we ll have it together we ve got a lot of country to get through first it s going to be fun though do you think we ll come to the sandwich town pretty soon we ll take the next town the next town was a lumbering town with one long street of frame and brick buildings along the highway the mills were by the railroad and lumber was piled high along the tracks and there was the smell of cypress and pine sawdust in the heat while roger filled the gas and had the water oil and air checked helena ordered hamburger sandwiches and barbecued pork sandwiches with hot sauce on them in a lunch counter and brought them to the car in a brown paper bag she had beer in another paper sack back on the highway again and out of the heat of the town they ate the sandwiches and drank cold beer that the girl opened i couldn t get any of our marriage beer she said this was the only kind there was it s good and cold wonderful after the barbecue the man said it was about like regal he said i d never be able to tell it from regal it s better than regal it had a funny name it wasn t a german name either but the labels soaked off it ll be on the caps i threw the caps away wait till we get out west they have better beer the further out you get i don t think they could have any better sandwich buns or any better barbecue aren t these good they re awfully good this isn t a part of the country where you eat very good either roger will you mind terribly if i go to sleep for a little while after lunch i won t if you re sleepy i d love it if you went to sleep i m not sleepy at all really i d tell you if i was there s another bottle of beer for you dammit i forgot to look at the cap that s good i like to drink it unknown but we could have remembered it for another time we ll get another new one roger would you really not mind if i went to sleep no beauty i can stay awake if you want please sleep and you ll wake up lonely and we can talk good night my dear roger thank you very much for the trip and the two drinks and the sandwiches and the unknown beer and the way down upon the swanee river and for where we are going you go to sleep my baby i will you wake me up if you want me she slept curled up in the deep seat and roger drove watching the wide road ahead for stock making fast time through the pine country trying to keep around seventy to try to see how much he could get over sixty miles onto the speedometer in each hour he had never been on this stretch of highway but he knew this part of the state and he was driving it now only to put it behind him you shouldn t have to waste country but on a long trip you have to the monotony tires you he thought that and the fact there are no vistas this would be a fine country on foot in cool weather but it is monotonous to drive through now i have not been driving long enough to settle into it yet but i should have more resiliency than i have i m not sleepy my eyes are bored i guess as well as tired i am not bored he thought it is just my eyes and the fact that it is a long time since i have been sitting still so long it is another game and i ll have to relearn it about day after tomorrow we will start to make real distance and not be tired by it i haven t sat still this long for a long time he reached forward and turned on the radio and tuned it helenadid not wake so he left it on and let it blur in with his thinking and his driving it is awfully nice having her in the car asleep he thought she is good company even when she is asleep you are a strange and lucky bastard he thought you are having much better luck than you deserve you just thought you had learned something about being alone and you really worked at it and you did learn something you got right to the edge of something then you backslid and ran with those worthless people not quite as worthless as the other batch but worthless enough and to spare probably they were even more worthless you certainly were worthless with them then you got through that and got in fine shape with tom and the kids and you knew you couldn t be happier and that there was nothing coming up except to be lonely again and then along comes this girl and you go right into happiness as though it were a country you were the biggest landowner in happiness is prewar hungary and you are count károlyi maybe not the biggest landowner but raised the most pheasant anyway i wonder if she will like to shoot pheasant maybe she will i can still shoot them they don t bother me i never asked her if she could shoot her mother shot quite well in that wonderful dope head trance she had she wasn t a wicked woman at the start she was a very nice woman pleasant and kind and successful in bed and i think she meant all the things she said to all the people i really think she meant them that is probably what made it so dangerous it always sounded as though she meant them anyway i suppose though it finally becomes a social defect to be unable to believe any marriage has not really been consummated until the husband has committed suicide things all ended so violently that started so pleasantly but i suppose that is always the way with drugs though i suppose among those spiders who eat their mates some of the mate eaters are remarkably attractive my dear she has never really never looked better dear henry was just a bonne bouche henry was nice too you know how much we all liked him none of those spiders take drugs either he thought of course that s what i should remember about this child exactly as you should remember the stalling speed of a plane that her mother was her mother that s all very simple he thought but you know your own mother was a bitch but you also know you are a bastard in quite different ways from her ways so why should her stalling speed be the same as her mother s yours isn t no one had ever said it was hers i mean what you said was that you should remember her mother as you would remember and so forth that s dirty too he thought for nothing for no reason when you need it most you have this girl freely and of her own will lovely loving and full of illusions about you and with her asleep beside you on the seat you start destroying her and denying her without any formalities of cocks crowing twice nor thrice nor even on the radio you are a bastard he thought and looked down at the girl asleep on the seat by him i suppose you start to destroy it for fear you will lose it or that it will take too great a hold on you or in case it shouldn t be true but it is not very good to do i would like to see you have something besides your kids you did not destroy sometime this girl s mother was and is a bitch and your mother was a bitch that ought to bring you closer to her and make you understand her that doesn t mean she has to be a bitch any more than you have to be a heel she thinks you are a much better guy than you are and maybe that will make you a better guy than you are you ve been good for a long time now and maybe you can be good as far as i know you haven t done anything cruel since that night on the dock with that citizen with the wife and the dog you haven t been drunk you haven t been wicked it s a shame you re not still in the church because you could make such a good confession she sees you the way you are now and you are a good guy as of the last few weeks and she probably thinks that is the way you have been all the time and that people just maligned you you really can start it all over now you really can please don t be silly another part of him said you really can he said to himself you can be just as good a guy as she thinks you are and as you are at this moment there is such a thing as starting it all over and you ve been given a chance to and you can do it and you will do it will you make all the promises again yes if necessary i will make all the promises and i will keep them not all the promises knowing you have broken them he could not say anything to that you mustn t be a crook before you start no i mustn t say what you can truly do each day and then do it each day do it a day at a time and keep each day s promises to her and to yourself that way i can start it all new he thought and still be straight you re getting to be an awful moralist he thought if you don t watch out you will bore her when weren t you always a moralist at different times don t fool yourself well at different places then don t fool yourself all right conscience he said only don t be so solemn and didactic get a load of this conscience old friend i know how useful and important you are and how you could have kept me out of all the trouble i have been in but couldn t you have a little lighter touch about it i know that conscience speaks in italics but sometimes you seem to speak in very boldfaced gothic script i would take it just as well from you conscience if you did not try to scare me just as i would consider the ten commandments just as seriously if they were not presented as graven on stone tablets you know conscience it has been a long time since we were frightened by the thunder now with the lightning there you have something but the thunder doesn t impress us so much any more i m trying to help you you son of a bitch his conscience said the girl was still sleeping and they were coming up the hill into tallahassee she will probably wake when we stop at the first light he thought but she did not and he drove through the old town and turned off to the left on u s 319 straight south and into the beautiful wooded country that ran down toward the gulf coast there s one thing about you daughter he thought not only can you outsleep anybody i ve ever known and have the best appetite i ve ever seen linked with a build like yours but you have an absolutely heaven given ability to not have to go to the bathroom their room was on the fourteenth floor and it was not very cool but with the fans on and the windows open it was better and when the bellboy had gone out helena said don t be disappointed darling please it s lovely i thought i could get you an air conditioned one they re awful to sleep in really like being in a vault this will be fine we could have tried the other two but they know me there they ll know us both here now what s our name mr and mrs robert harris that s a splendid name we must try to live up to it do you want to bathe first no you all right i m going to really bathe though go ahead go to sleep in the tub if you want i may i didn t sleep all day did i you were wonderful there was some pretty dull going too it wasn t bad lots of it was lovely but new orleans isn t really the way i thought it would be did you always know it was so flat and dull i don t know what i expected marseilles i suppose and to see the river it s only to eat and drink in the part right around here doesn t look so bad at night it s really sort of nice let s not go out until it s dark it s all right around here some of it is lovely we ll have that and then in the morning we ll be on our way that only leaves time for one meal that s all right we ll come back in cold weather when we can really eat darling she said this is the first sort of letdown we ve had so let s not let it let us down we ll have long baths and some drinks and a meal twice as expensive as we can afford and we ll go to bed and make wonderful love the hell with new orleans in the movies roger said we ll have new orleans in bed eat first didn t you order some white rock and ice yes do you want a drink no i was just worried about you it will be along roger said there was a knock at the door here it is you get started on the tub it s going to be wonderful she said there will just be my nose out of water and the tips of my breasts maybe and my toes and i m going to have it just as cold as it will run the bellboy brought the pitcher of ice the bottled water and the papers took his tip and went out roger made a drink and settled down to read he was tired and it felt good to lie back on the bed with two pillows folded under his neck and read the evening and the morning papers things were not so good in spain but it had not really taken shape yet he read all the spanish news carefully in the three papers and then read the other cable news and then the local news are you all right darling helena called from the bathroom i m wonderful have you undressed yes do you have anything on no are you very brown still do you know where we swam this morning was the loveliest beach i ve ever seen i wonder how it can get so white and so floury darling are you very very brown why i was just thinking about you being in cold water s supposed to be good for that i m brown under the water you d like it i like it you keep on reading she said you are reading aren t you yes is spain all right no i m so sorry is it very bad no not yet really roger yes do you love me yes daughter you go back and read now i ll think about that here underwater roger lay back and listened to the noises that came up from the street below and read the papers and drank his drink this was almost the best hour of the day it was the hour he had always gone to the café alone when he had lived in paris to read the evening papers and have his aperitif this town was nothing like paris nor was it like orleans either orleans wasn t much of a town either it was pleasant enough though probably a better town to live in than this one he didn t know the environs of this town though and he knew he was stupid about it he had always liked new orleans the little that he knew of it but it was a letdown to anyone who expected very much and this certainly was not the month to hit it in the best time he had ever hit it was with andy one time in the winter and another time driving through with david the time going north with andy they had not come through new orleans they had bypassed it to the north to save time and driven north of lake pontchartrain and across through hammond to baton rouge on a new road that was being built so they made many detours and then they had gone north through mississippi in the southern edge of the blizzard that was coming down from the north when they had hit new orleans was coming south again but it was still cold and they had a wonderful time eating and drinking and the city had seemed gay and sharp with cold instead of moist and damp and andy had roamed all the antique shops and bought a sword with his christmas money he kept the sword in the luggage compartment behind the seat in the car and slept with it in his bed at night when he and david had come through it had been in the winter and they had made their headquarters in that restaurant he would have to try to find the non tourist one he remembered it as in a cellar and having teakwood tables and chairs or else they sat on benches it was probably not like that and was like a dream and he did not remember its name nor where it was located except he thought it was in the opposite direction from antoine s on an east and west not a north and south street and he and david had stayed in there two days he probably had it mixed up with some other place there was a place in lyons and another near the parc monceau that always were merged in his dreams that was one of the things about being drunk when you were young you made places in your mind that afterwards you could never find and they were better than any places could ever be he knew he hadn t been to this place with andy though i m coming out she said feel how cool she said on the bed feel how cool all the way down no don t go away i like you no let me take a shower if you want but i d rather not you don t wash the pickled onions do you before you put them in the cocktail you don t wash the vermouth do you i wash the glass and the ice it s different you re not the glass and the ice roger please do that again isn t again a nice word again and again he said so tly he felt the lovely curve from her hip bone up under her ribs and the apple slope of her breasts i it a good curve he kissed her breasts and she said be awfully careful when they re so cold be very careful and kind do you know about them aching yes he said i know about aching then she said the other one is jealous later she said they didn t plan things right for me to have two breasts and you only one way to kiss they made everything so far apart his hand covered the other the pressure between the fingers barely touching and then his lips wandered up over all the lovely coolness and met hers they met and brushed very lightly sweeping from side to side losing nothing of the lovely outer screen and then he kissed her oh darling she said oh please darling my dearest kind lovely love oh please please please my dear love after quite a long time she said i m so sorry if i was selfish about your bath but when i came out of mine i was selfish you weren t selfish roger do you still love me yes daughter do you change how you feel afterwards no he lied i don t at all i just feel better afterwards i mustn t tell you you tell me no i won t tell you too much but we do have a lovely time don t we yes he said very truthfully after we bathe we can go out i ll go now you know maybe we ought to stay tomorrow i ought to have my nails done and my hair washed i can do it all myself but you might like it better done properly that way we could sleep late and then have part of one day in town and then leave the next morning that would be good i like new orleans now don t you new orleans is wonderful it s changed a lot since we came here i ll go in i ll only be a minute then you can bathe i only want a shower afterwards they went down in the elevator there were negro girls who ran the elevators and they were pretty the elevator was full with a party from the floor above so they went down fast going down in the elevator made him feel hollower than ever inside he felt helena against him where they were crowded if you ever get so that you don t feel anything when you see flying fish go out of water or when an elevator drops you better turn in your suit he said to her i feel it still she said are those the only things you have to turn in your suit for the door had opened and they were crossing the old fashioned marble lobby crowded at this hour with people waiting for other people people waiting to go to dinner people just waiting and roger said walk ahead and let me see you where do i walk to straight toward the door of the air conditioned bar he caught her at the door you re beautiful you walk wonderfully and if i were here and saw you now for the first time i d be in love with you if i saw you across the room i d be in love with you if i saw you for the first time everything would turn over inside of me and i d ache right through my chest that s the way i feel all of the time you can t feel that way all of the time maybe not but i can feel that way an awfully big part of the time daughter isn t new orleans a fine place weren t we lucky to come here it felt very cold in the big high ceilinged pleasant dark wood panelled bar room and helena sitting beside roger at a table said look and showed him the tiny prickles of gooseflesh on her brown arm you can do that to me too she said but this time it s air conditioning it s really cold it feels wonderful what should we drink should we get tight let s gel a little tight i ll drink absinthe then do you think i should why don t you try it didn t you ever no i was saving it to drink with you don t make up things it s not made up i truly did daughter don t make up a lot of things it s not made up i didn t save my maidenly state because i thought it would bore you and besides i gave you up for a while but i did save absinthe truly do you have any real absinthe roger asked the bar waiter it s not supposed to be the waiter said but i have some the real couvet pontarlier sixty eighth degree not the tarragova yes sir the waiter said i can t bring you the bottle it will be in an ordinary pernod bottle i can tell it roger said i believe you sir the waiter said do you want a frappe or drip straight drip you have the dripping saucers naturally sir without sugar won t the lady want sugar sir no we ll let her try it without very good sir er the waiter was gone roger took helena s hand under the table hello my beauty this is wonderful us here and this good old poison coming and we ll eat in some fine place and then go to bed do you like bed as much as all that i never did but i do now why did you never let s not talk about it we won t i don t ask you about everyone you ve been in love with we don t have to talk about london do we no we can talk about you and how beautiful you are you know you still move like a colt roger tell me did i really walk so it pleased you you walk so that it breaks my heart all i do is keep my shoulders back and my head straight up and walk i know there are tricks i ought to know when you look the way you do daughter there aren t any tricks you re so beautiful that i d be happy just to look at you not permanently i hope daytimes he said look daughter the one thing about absinthe is that you have to drink it awfully slowly it won t taste strong mixed with the water but you have to believe it is i believe credo roger i hope you ll never change it the way lady caroline did i ll never change it except for cause but you re not like him at all i wouldn t want to be you re not someone tried to tell me you were at college they meant it as a compliment i think but i was terribly angry and made an awful row with the english professor they made us read you you know i mean they made the others read it i d read it all there isn t very much roger don t you think you ought to work more i m going to work now as soon as we get out west maybe we shouldn t stay tomorrow then i ll be so happy when you work happier than now yes she said happier than now i ll work hard you ll see roger do you think i m bad for you do i make you drink or make love more than you should no daughter i m awfully glad if it s true because i want to be good for you i know it s a weakness and silliness but i make up stories to myself in the daytime and in one of them i save your life sometimes it s from drowning and sometimes from in from of a train and sometimes in a plane and sometimes in the mountains you can laugh if you want and then there is one where i come into your life when you are disgusted and disappointed with all women and you love me so much and i take such good care of you that you get an epoch of writing wonderfully that s a wonderful one i was making it up again today in the car that s one i m pretty sure i ve seen in the movies or read somewhere oh i know i ve seen it there too and i m sure i ve read it too but don t you think it happens don t you think i could be good for you not in a wishy washy way or by giving you a little baby but really good for you so you d write better than you ever wrote and be happy at the same time they do it in pictures why shouldn t we do it the absinthe had come and from the saucers of cracked ice placed over the top of the glasses water that roger added from a small pitcher was dripping down into the clear yellowish liquor turning it to an opalescent milkiness try that roger said when it was the right cloudy color it s very strange the girl said and warming in the stomach it tastes like medicine it is medicine pretty strong medicine i don t really need medicine yet the girl said but this is awfully good when will we be tight almost any time i m going to have three you take what you want but take them slow i ll see how i do i don t know anything about it yet except that it s like medicine roger yes daughter he was feeling the warmth of the alchemist s furnace starting at the pit of his stomach roger don t you think i really could be good for you the way i was in the story i made up i think we could be good to each other and for each other but i don t like it to be on a basis of stories i think the story business is bad but you see that s the way i am i m a story maker upper and i m romantic i know but that s how i am if i was practical i d never have come to bimini i don t know roger thought to himself if that was what you wanted to do that was quite practical you didn t just make up a story about it and the other part of him thought you must be slipping you bastard if the absinthe can bring the heel in you out that quickly but what he said was i don t know daughter i think the story business is dangerous first you could make up stories about something innocuous like me and then there could be all sorts of other stories there might be bad ones you re not so innocuous oh yes i am or the stories are anyway saving me is fairly innocuous but first you might be saving me and then next you might be saving the world then you might start saving yourself i d like to save the world i always wished i could that s awfully big to make a story about but i want to save you first i m getting scared roger said he drank some more of the absinthe and he felt better but he was worried have you always made up the stories since i can remember i ve made them up about you for twelve years i didn t tell you all the ones there are hundreds of them why don t you write instead of making up the stories i do write but it s not as much fun as making up the stories and it s much harder then they re not nearly as good the ones i make up are wonderful but you re always the heroine in the stories you write no it s not that simple well let s not worry about it now he took another sip of the absinthe and rolled it under his tongue i never worried about it at all the girl said what i wanted always was you and now i m with you now i want you to be a great writer maybe we d better not even stop for dinner he said he was still very worried and the absinthe warmth had moved up to his head now and he did not trust it there he said to himself what did you think could happen that would not have consequences what woman in the world did you think could be as sound as a good secondhand buick car you ve only known two sound women in your life and you lost them both what will she want after that and the other part of his brain said hail heel the absinthe certainly brought you out early tonight so he said daughter for now let s just try to be good to each other and love each other he got the word out though the absinthe made it a difficult word for him to articulate and as soon as we get out where we are going i will work just as hard and as well as i can that s lovely she said and you don t mind my telling you i made up stories no he lied they were very nice stories which was true can i have another she asked sure he wished now they had never taken it although it was the drink he loved best of almost any in the world but almost everything bad that had ever happened to him had happened when he was drinking absinthe those bad things which were his own fault he could tell that she knew something was wrong and he pulled hard against himself so that there would be nothing wrong i didn t say something i shouldn t did i no daughter here s to you here s to us the second one always tastes better than the first because certain taste buds are numbed against the bitterness of the wormwood so that without becoming sweet or even sweeter it becomes less bitter and there are parts of the tongue that enjoy it more it is strange and wonderful but all it does so far is just bring us to the edge of misunderstanding the girl said i know he said let s stick together through it was it that you thought i was ambitious it s all right about the stories no it s not all right with you i couldn t love you as much as i do and not know when you re upset i m not upset he lied and i m not going to be upset he resolved let s talk about something else it will be wonderful when we re out there and you can work she is a little obtuse he thought or maybe does it affect her that way but he said it will be but you won t be bored of course not i work awfully hard when i work i ll work too that will be fun he said like mr and mrs browning i never saw the play roger do you have to make fun of it i don t know now pull yourself together he said to himself now is the time to pull yourself together be good now i make fun of everything he said i think it will be fine and it s much better for you to be working when m writing will you mind reading mine sometimes no i ll love to really no of course i ll be really happy to really when you drink this it makes you feel as though you could do anything the girl said i m awfully glad i never drank it before do you mind if we talk about writing roger hell no why did you say hell no i don t know he said let s talk about writing really i mean it what about writing now you ve made me feel like a fool you don t have to take me in as an equal or a partner i only meant i d like to talk about it if you d like to let s talk about it what about it the girl began to cry sitting straight up and looking at him she did not sob nor turn her head away she just looked at him and tears came down her cheeks and her mouth grew fuller but it did not twist nor break please daughter he said please let s talk about it or anything else and i ll be friendly she bit her lip and then said i suppose i wanted to be partners even though i said i didn t i guess that was part of the dream and why the hell shouldn t it be roger thought what do you have to hurt her for you bastard be good now fast before you hurt her you see i d like to have you not just like me in bed but like me in the head and like to talk about things that interest us both we will he said we will now bratchen daughter what about writing my dear beauty what i wanted to tell you was that drinking this made me feel the way i feel when i am going to write that i could do anything and that i can write wonderfully then i write and it s just dull the truer i try to make it the duller it is and when it isn t true it s silly give me a kiss here yes he leaned over the table and kissed her you re awfully beautiful when you cry i m awfully sorry i cried she said you don t really mind if we talk about it do you of course not you see that was one of the parts of it i d looked forward to yes i guess it was he thought well why shouldn t it be and we ll do it maybe i will get to like it what was it about writing he said besides how it seems it s going to be wonderful and then it turns out dull wasn t it that way with you when you started no when i started i d feel as though i could do anything and while i was doing it i would feel like i was making the whole world and when i would read it i would think this is so good i couldn t have written it i must have read it somewhere probably in the saturday evening post weren t you ever discouraged not when i started i thought i was writing the greatest stories ever written and that people just didn t have sense enough to know it were you really that conceited worse probably only i didn t think i was conceited i was just confident if those were your first stories the ones i read you had a right to be confident they weren t he said all those first confident stories were lost the ones you read were when i wasn t confident at all how were they lost roger it s an awful story i ll tell it to you sometime wouldn t you tell it to me now i hate to because it s happened to other people and to better writers than i am and that makes it sound as though it were made up there s no reason for it ever happening and yet it s happened many times and it still hurts like a bastard no it doesn t really it has a scar over it now a good thick scar please tell me about it if it s a scar and not a scab it won t hurt to will it no daughter well i was very methodical in those days and i kept original manuscripts in one cardboard folder and typed originals in another and carbons in another i guess it wasn t so cockeyed methodical i don t know how else you d do it oh the hell with this story no tell me well i was working at the lausanne conference and it was the holidays coming up and andrew s mother who was a lovely girl and very beautiful and kind i was never jealous of her the girl said i was jealous of david s and tom s mother you shouldn t be jealous of either of them they were both wonderful i was jealous of dave s and tom s mother helena said i m not now that s awfully white of you roger said maybe we ought to send her a cable go on with the story please and don t be bad all right the aforesaid andy s mother thought she would bring down my stuff so i could have it with me and be able to do some work while we had the holiday together she was going to bring it to me as a surprise she hadn t written anything about it and when i met her at lausanne i didn t know anything about it she was a day late and had wired about it the only thing i knew was that she was crying when i met her and she cried and cried and when i would ask her what was the matter she told me it was too awful to tell me and then she would cry again she cried as though her heart was broken do i have to tell this story please tell me all that morning she would not tell me and i thought of all the worst possible things that could have happened and asked her if they had happened but she just shook her head the worst thing i could think of was that she had tromper ed me or fallen in love with someone else and when i asked her that she said oh how can you say that and cried some more i felt relieved then and then finally she told me she had packed all the manuscript folders in a suitcase and left the suitcase with her other bags in her first class compartment in the paris lausanne milan express in the gare de lyon while she went out on the quai to buy a london paper and a bottle of evian water you remember the gare de lyon and how they would have sort of push tables with papers and magazines and mineral water and small flasks of cognac and sandwiches with ham between sliced long pointed end bread wrapped in paper and other push carts with pillows and blankets that you rented well when she got back into the compartment with her paper and her evian water the suitcase was gone she did everything there was to be done you know the french police the first thing she had to do was show her carte d identité and try to prove she was not an international crook herself and that she did not suffer from hallucinations and that she was sure she actually had such a suitcase and were the papers of political importance and besides madame surely there exist copies she had that all night and the next day when a detective came and searched the flat for the suitcase and found a shotgun of mine and demanded to know if i had a permis de chasse i think there was some doubt in the minds of the police whether she should be allowed to proceed to lausanne and she said the detective had followed her to the train and appeared in the compartment just before the train pulled out and said you are quite sure madame that all your baggage is intact now that you have not lost anything else no other important papers so i said but it s all right really you can t have brought the originals and the typed originals and the carbons but i did she said roger i know i did it was true too i found out it was true when i went up to paris to see i remember walking up the stairs and opening the door to the flat unlocking it and pulling back on the brass handle of the sliding lock and the odor of eau de tavel in the kitchen and the dust that had sifted in through the windows on the table in the dining room and going to the cupboard where i kept the stuff in the dining room and it was all gone i was sure it would be there that some of the manila folders would be there because i could see them there so clearly in my mind but there was nothing there at all not even my paper clips in a cardboard box nor my pencils and erasers nor my pencil sharpener that was shaped like a fish nor my envelopes with the return address typed in the upper left hand corner nor my international postage coupons that you enclosed for them to send the manuscripts back with and that were kept in a small persian lacquered box that had a pornographic painting inside of it they were all gone they had all been packed in the suitcase even the red stick of wax was gone that i had used to seal letters and packages i stood there and looked at the painting inside the persian box and noticed the curious over proportion of the parts represented that always characterizes pornography and i remember thinking how much i disliked pornographic pictures and painting and writing and how after this box had been given to me by a friend on his return from persia i had only looked at the painted interior once to please the friend and that after that i had only used the box as a convenience to keep coupons and stamps in and had never seen the pictures i felt almost as though i could not breathe when i saw that there really were no folders with originals nor folders with typed copies nor folders with carbons and then i locked the door of the cupboard and went into the next room which was the bedroom and lay down on the bed and put a pillow between my legs and my arms around another pillow and lay there very quietly i had never put a pillow between my legs before and i had never lain with my arms around a pillow but now i needed them very badly i knew everything i had ever written and everything that i had great confidence in was gone i had rewritten them so many times and gotten them just how i wanted them and i knew i could not write them again because once i had them right i forgot them completely and each time i ever read them i wondered at them and at how i had ever done them so i lay there without moving with the pillows for friends and i was in despair i had never had despair before true despair nor have i ever had it since my forehead lay against the persian shawl that covered the bed which was only a mattress and springs set on the floor and the bed cover was dusty too and i smelt the dust and lay there with my despair and the pillows were my only comfort what were they that were gone the girl asked eleven stories a novel and poems poor poor roger no i wasn t so poor because there were more inside not them but to come but i was in bad shape you see i hadn t believed they could be gone not everything what did you do nothing very practical i lay there for a while did you cry no i was all dried up inside like the dust in the house weren t you ever in despair of course in london but i could cry i m sorry daughter i got to thinking about this thing and i forgot i m awfully sorry what did you do let s see i got up and went down the stairs and spoke to the concierge and she asked me about madame she was worried because the police had been to the flat and had asked her questions but she was still cordial she asked me if we had found the valise that had been stolen and i said no and she said it was dirty luck and a great misfortune and was it true that all my works were in it i said yes and she said but how was it there were no copies i said the copies were there too then she said mais ça alors why were copies made to lose them with the originals i said madame had packed them by mistake it was a great mistake she said a fatal mistake but monsieur can remember them surely no i said but she said monsieur will have to remember them il faut le souvienne rappeler oui i said mais ce n est pas possible je ne m en souviens plus mais il faut faire un ef ort she said je le ferais i said but it s useless mais qu est ce que monsieur va faire she asked monsieur has worked here for three years i have seen monsieur work at the café on the corner i ve seen monsieur at work at the table in the dining room when i ve brought things up je sais que monsieur travaille comme un sourd qu es ce que il faut faire maintenant il faut recommencer i said then the concierge started to cry i put my arm around her and she smelled of armpit sweat and dust and old black clothes and her hair smelled rancid and she cried with her head on my chest were there poems too she asked yes i said what unhappiness she said but you can recall those surely je tâcherai de la faire i said do it she said do it tonight i will i told her oh monsieur she said madame is beautiful and amiable and tous le qui il y a de gentil but what a grave error it was will you drink a glass of marc with me of course i told her and sniffing she left my chest to find the bottle and the two small glasses to the new works she said to them i said monsieur will be a member of the académie française no i said the académie americaine she said would you prefer rum i have some rum no i said marc is very good good she said another glass now she said go out and get yourself drunk and since marcelle is not coming to do the flat as soon as my husband comes in to hold down this dirty loge i will go upstairs and clean the place up for you to sleep tonight do you want me to buy anything for you do you want me to make breakfast i asked her certainly she said give me ten francs and i ll bring you the change i d make you dinner but you ought to eat out tonight even though it is more expensive allez voir des amis et manger quelque part if it wasn t for my husband i d come with you come on and have a drink at the café des amateurs now i said we ll have a hot grog no i can t leave this cage until my husband comes she said débine toi maintenant leave me the key it will all be in order when you get back she was a fine woman and i felt better already because i knew there was only one thing to do to start over but i did not know if i could do it some of the stories had been about boxing and some about baseball and others about horse racing they were the things i had known best and had been closest to and several were about the first war writing them i had felt all the emotion i had to feel about those things and i had put it all in and all the knowledge of them that i could express and i had rewritten and rewritten until it was all in them and all gone out of me because i had worked on newspapers since i was very young i could never remember anything once i had written it down as each day you wiped your memory clear with writing as you might wipe a blackboard clear with a sponge or a wet rag and i still had that evil habit and now it had caught up with me but the concierge and the smell of the concierge and her practicality and determination hit my despair as a nail might hit it if it were driven in cleanly and soundly and i thought i must do something about this something practical something that will be good for me even if it cannot help about the stories already i was half glad the novel was gone because i could see already as you begin to see clearly over the water when a rainstorm lifts on the ocean as the wind carries it out to sea that i could write a better novel but i missed the stories as though they were a combination of my house and my job my only gun my small savings and my wife also my poems but the despair was going and there was only missing now as after a great loss missing is very bad too i know about missing the girl said poor daughter he said missing is bad but it doesn t kill you but despair would kill you in just a little time really kill you i think so he said can we have another she asked will you tell me the rest this is the sort of thing i always wondered about we can have another roger said and i ll tell you the rest if it doesn t bore you roger you mustn t say that about boring me i bore the hell out of myself sometimes he said so it seemed normal i might bore you please make the drink and then tell me what happened about the author ernest hemingway was born in oak park illinois in 1899 and began his writing career for
